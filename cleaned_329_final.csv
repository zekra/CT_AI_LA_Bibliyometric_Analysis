Research ranges from general, descriptive models of heuristic decision making to detailed studies of decision parameters. This paper introduces a model that formalizes and integrates several descriptive models so that it can serve both as a framework for psychological models and as an algorithm for computational decision making. We set special focus on the instantiation of this model with respect to aggregating cue values by reviewing some methods from the field of computational social choice. To show its applicability in the context of artificial intelligence we present a case study of computational problem solving.;243-259;2;20;English;"Computational social choice; Decision making; Heuristics; HEURISTICS; HUMAN-PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; TRAVELING SALESMAN"
YTLVLAEL;journalArticle;2024;"Weng, XJ; Ye, HY; Dai, Y; Ng, OL";Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Computational Thinking in Educational Contexts: A Systematic Review of Instructional Design and Student Learning Outcomes;JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING RESEARCH;0735-6331;10.1177/07356331241248686;A growing body of research is focusing on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and computational thinking (CT) to enhance student learning outcomes. Many researchers have designed instructional activities to achieve various learning goals within this field. Despite the prevalence of studies focusing on instructional design and student learning outcomes, how instructional efforts result in the integration of AI and CT in students' learning processes remains unclear. To address this research gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of empirical studies that have integrated AI and CT for student development. We collected 18 papers from four prominent research databases in the fields of education and AI technology: Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, and ACM. We coded the collected studies, highlighting the students' learning processes in terms of research methodology and context, learning tools and instructional design, student learning outcomes, and the interaction between AI and CT. The integration of AI and CT occurs in two ways: the integration of disciplinary knowledge and leveraging AI tools to learn CT. Specifically, we discovered that AI- and CT-related tools, projects, and problems facilitated student-centered instructional designs, resulting in productive AI and CT learning outcomes.;1640-1670;6;62;English;"artificial intelligence; computational thinking; COURSES; instructional design; learning outcomes; MATHEMATICS; PERFORMANCE; SCHOOL-STUDENTS; systematic review; Artificial Intelligence; Computation; Thinking Skills; Technology Integration; Instructional Design; Technology Uses in Education; Student Development; Educational Environment; Educational Research; Outcomes of Education"

Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.;;;83;English;"ChatGPT; ACCESS; AI Literacy; Cognitive Absorption; Computational Thinking; Digital Divide; FUTURE; INEQUALITIES; INFORMATION; INSTRUMENT; INTERNET; MODELS; VALIDITY"

In this study, Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy was analyzed as how it mediates the association between Computational Thinking Skills (CTS) and Organizational Agility (OA) among secondary teachers. A quantitative causal mediation analysis design was utilized in this study. Standardized AI literacy test, CTS Test, and OA test instruments were utilized to gather pertinent data among 305 respondents. The test instruments were first subjected to confirmatory factor analysis for model fitness. Path and mediation analysis through structural equation modeling revealed that CTS significantly predicts AI literacy, AI Literacy significantly predicts OA, and CTS significantly predicts OA. It was found out that AI literacy partially mediates the relationship between CTS and OA among teachers. This recommends that schools should conduct a comprehensive training program to enhance teachers' CTS and AI proficiency for schools' sustained agility.;616-629;5;82;English;"MATHEMATICS; AI literacy; computational thinking skills; mediation analysis; organizational agility; structural equation modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Foreign Countries; Thinking Skills; Mental Computation; Organizational Objectives; Philippines; Secondary School Teachers; Teacher Characteristics; Technological Literacy"

Therefore, extensive research is required in this field. Worldwide, new ways to address this difficult task have been developed: visual execution environments and approaches by text programming or visual programming are among the most popular. This paper addresses the complex task by using a visual execution environment (VEE) to introduce the first programming concepts that should be covered in any introductory programming course. These concepts include variables, input and output, conditionals, loops, arrays, functions, and files. This study explores two approaches to achieve this goal: visual programming (using Scratch) and text programming (using Java) to improve CT. Additionally, it proposes an AI recommendation model into the VEE to further improve the effectiveness of developing CT among secondary education students. This integrated model combines the capabilities of an AI learning system module and a personalized learning module to better address the task at hand. To pursue this task, an experiment has been carried out among 23 preservice secondary teachers' students in two universities, one in Madrid, Spain, and the other in Galway, Ireland. The overall results showed a significant improvement in the Scratch group. However, when analyzing the results based on specific programming concepts, significance was observed only in the Scratch group, specifically for the Loop concept.;;6;12;English;"computational thinking; preservice teachers; programming; recommendation model with AI; secondary education"
GAUC3GDM;journalArticle;2025;Hsu, HP;From Programming to Prompting: Developing Computational Thinking through Large Language Model-Based Generative Artificial Intelligence;TECHTRENDS;8756-3894;10.1007/s11528-025-01052-6;The advancement of large language model-based generative artificial intelligence (LLM-based GenAI) has sparked significant interest in its potential to address challenges in computational thinking (CT) education. CT, a critical problem-solving approach in the digital age, encompasses elements such as abstraction, iteration, and generalisation. However, its abstract nature often poses barriers to meaningful teaching and learning. This paper proposes a constructionist prompting framework that leverages LLM-based GenAI to foster CT development through natural language programming and prompt engineering. By engaging learners in crafting and refining prompts, the framework aligns CT elements with five prompting principles, enabling learners to apply and develop CT in contextual and organic ways. A three-phase workshop is proposed to integrate the framework into teacher education, equipping future teachers to support learners in developing CT through interactions with LLM-based GenAI. The paper concludes by exploring the framework's theoretical, practical, and social implications, advocating for its implementation and validation.;485-506;3;69;English;"Computational thinking; Constructionism; DESIGN; EDUCATION; Generative artificial intelligence; K-12; Large language model; Natural language programming; NATURAL-LANGUAGE; Prompt engineering; TEACHERS; Artificial Intelligence; Programming; Computation; Problem Solving; Prompting; Thinking Skills; Natural Language Processing; Engineering; Teacher Workshops"

Therefore, it is feasible and necessary to utilize STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Liberal Arts, and Mathematics) education to learn artificial intelligence courses. Computational thinking skills are of vital importance to high school students. This paper integrates artificial intelligence education with STEAM model with the aim of enhancing students' computational thinking skills. First, we investigate the feasibility of this model and set teaching objectives about artificial intelligence curricula. Second, artificial intelligence curricula with STEAM model is proposed to carry out interdisciplinary artificial intelligence knowledge acquisition. Finally, the effects of this model on students' computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy are evaluated. One hundred thirty-six participants are recruited from a high school in Beijing. The results reveal that the integration of artificial intelligence education with STEAM is able to promote computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy of the students in the experimental group. The main implication of this study is that artificial intelligence education in light of STEAM model can be used as a teaching guide for the combination of artificial intelligence curricula with multi-disciplinary knowledge at the primary and secondary levels.;383-403;2;33;English;"STUDENTS; Artificial Intelligence; Foreign Countries; High School Students; Thinking Skills; Computer Science Education; Teaching Methods; Self Efficacy; Interdisciplinary Approach; STEM Education; Learning Motivation; Art Education; China (Beijing)"

Although these factors have been studied separately, their combined effects remain underexplored. To address this gap, a 2x2 factorial experiment was conducted in this study to examine the effect of scaffolding type (conceptual versus problem-solving) and timing (immediate versus delayed) on CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. A total of 136 third graders from four classes were assigned to four experimental conditions: delayed conceptual scaffolding, immediate conceptual scaffolding, immediate problem-solving scaffolding, and delayed problem-solving scaffolding. The study was conducted over 6 weeks using the machine learning unit of an artificial intelligence (AI) course. The results, as measured by knowledge tests and final worksheets, showed that problem-solving scaffolding and immediate scaffolding were more effective in developing students' CT concepts than conceptual scaffolding and delayed scaffolding. Lag sequential analysis indicated that students guided by problem-solving scaffolding and delayed scaffolding developed more complete problem-solving paths and achieved higher levels of CT practice. Additionally, an analysis of students' learning reflections revealed that most students could explain the functions of machine learning techniques. However, students guided by problem-solving scaffolding and immediate scaffolding were better at understanding and reflecting on the problem-solving process. These findings provide valuable insights for researchers and practical guidance for teachers. By highlighting effective scaffolding methods and their timing, this study advances CT education and helps prepare students for a technology-driven world.;338-367;4;28;English;"Artificial intelligence; Computational thinking; Elementary education; INQUIRY; LEARNERS; Scaffolding; SCIENCE; Timing of scaffolding"

Early publications received the highest number of citations, such as in 2007 (18 citations), while recent studies show a more even distribution of citations, reflecting a shift from basic to applied research. This analysis highlights the important role of AI in enhancing CT development through learning strategies, educational technology, and cross-disciplines. The impact of AI implementation is seen in various aspects of education, such as learning strategies, educational media, and the relationship between CT and other skills.

It is one of the few themes that was the object of two ICMI studies, the most recent being published in 2010. Two new approaches, emerging lately in the teaching and learning of Mathematics at all levels, will be discussed: Computational Thinking (CT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I will discuss both in comparison, arguing they are very different and can even induce very different directions to Mathematics Education. Considering the CT approach as a variation on the theme of Problem Solving puts it as a skill that is as fundamental as numeracy. AI is also connected to problem solving as an emulator of human problem-solving approaches. Inappropriate use of AI has been considered problematic, being called a 'stochastic parrot'. I will try here to compare CT and AI using Curriculum Analysis: which are the educational purposes, which relevant experiences can we point out, how can these be implemented in school, how are they effective. I will argue that CT is important in introducing an 'algorithmic dimension of mathematics' in Mathematics Teaching and that AI in its present form as Generative AI is not adequate to develop concepts of mathematical literacy. I will show how the 'algorithmic dimension of mathematics' can be implemented in school with the example of the curricular options that were made in the new curriculum for Mathematics in Portugal.;1426-1437;8;56;English;"artificial intelligence; Computational thinking; Artificial Intelligence; mathematics teaching; Computation; Foreign Countries; Problem Solving; Thinking Skills; Teaching Methods; Mathematics Instruction; Mathematics Skills; Instructional Effectiveness; Algorithms; Technology Uses in Education; Comparative Analysis; Curriculum Evaluation; Mathematics Curriculum; National Curriculum; Numeracy; Portugal"

However, most existing human-computer collaborative programming learning is supported by traditional computers with a relatively low level of personalized interaction, which greatly limits the efficiency of students' efficiency of programming learning and development of computational thinking. To address the above issues, this study introduces generative AI into human-computer collaborative programming learning and proposes a dialogue-negotiated human-computer collaborative programming learning method based on generative AI. The method focuses on the problems-solving process and constructs multiple agents through Prompt design, which enable students to improve their computational thinking and master programming skills in the process of human-computer interaction for problem-solving. Finally, a quasi-experiment was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in a 10th grade computer programming course in a high school. 43 students in the experimental group learned with the proposed method, while 42 students in the control group adopted the traditional computer-supported human-computer collaborative programming learning method.

With the growing relevance of computational thinking, these two efforts have become more closely connected. This survey examines these connections and points to the need for educating the general public to understand the challenges which the increasing integration of AI in human lives pose. We describe three different framings of computational thinking: cognitive, situated, and critical. Each framing offers valuable, but different insights into what computational thinking can and should be. The differences between the three framings also concern the views of learning that they embody. We combine the three framings into one framework which emphasizes that (1) computational thinking activities involve engagement with algorithmic processes, and (2) the mere use of a digital artifact for an activity is not sufficient to count as computational thinking. We further present a set of approaches to learning computational thinking. We argue for the significance of computational thinking as regards artificial intelligence on three counts: (i) Human developers use computational thinking to create and develop artificial intelligence systems, (ii) understanding how humans learn can enrich artificial intelligence systems, and (iii) such enriched systems will be explainable. We conclude with an introduction of the articles included in the Special Issue, focusing on how they call upon and develop the themes of this survey.;May.16;1;36;English;"Artificial intelligence; Computational thinking; K-12; Framework for computational thinking; Learning; LITERACY; Problem-solving"

We argue that the introduction of AI contents at schools through practical, hands-on, projects is the way to go to educate conscientious and critical citizens of the future, to awaken vocations among youth people, as well as to foster students' computational thinking skills. However, most existing programming platforms for education lack some of the required educational features to develop a complete understanding of AI. In this paper we present LearningML, a new platform aimed at learning supervised Machine Learning (ML), one of the most successful AI techniques that is in the basis of almost every current AI application. This work describes the main functionalities of the tool and discusses some decisions taken during its design. For its conception, we have taken into account lessons learned from the research literature on introducing AI in school and from the analysis of other educational tools built with the aim to allow learners to use ML. We offer as well some promising results obtained after a preliminary testing pilot workshop. Finally, the next steps in the development of LearningML are presented, focused on the face and instructional validation of the tool.;;63;20;English;"Computational Thinking; Educational Tools; Learning by doing; Machine Learning"

This hesitancy poses a significant obstacle, particularly given the prevalence of educational technology and the abundance of data generated in these environments. In contrast to higher education institutions that readily integrate learning analytics tools into their educational governance, high schools often harbor skepticism regarding the tools' impact and returns. To overcome these challenges, this work aims to harness learning analytics to address critical areas, such as school dropout rates, the need to foster student collaboration, improving argumentation and writing skills, and the need to enhance computational thinking across all age groups. The goal is to empower teachers and decision makers with learning analytics tools that will equip them to identify learners in vulnerable or exceptional situations, enabling educational authorities to take suitable actions that are aligned with students' needs; this could potentially involve adapting learning processes and organizational structures to meet the needs of students. This work also seeks to evaluate the impact of such analytics tools on education within a multi-dimensional and scalable domain, ranging from individual learners to teachers and principals, and extending to broader governing bodies. The primary objective is articulated through the development of a user-friendly AI-based dashboard for learning. This prototype aims to provide robust support for teachers and principals who are dedicated to enhancing the education they provide within the intricate and multifaceted social domain of the school.";;3;16;English;"artificial intelligence; education; adaptive learning; dashboard; learning analytics; machine learning"

Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5-6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children.;;;215;English;"Computational thinking; STUDENTS; Early childhood education; Improving classroom teaching; Interactive learning environments; INTERVENTION; Metaphors; Pedagogical issues; Teaching/learning strategies"

Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical framework of this paper adopts a sociocultural perspective where knowledge is constructed in interactions with others (Vygotsky, 1978). Others also refers to themultiplicity of technologies that surround us, including both the digital artefacts of our new media world, and the human methods and specialized processes acting in the world. Technology is not simply a tool for human intention. It is an actor in the cognitive ecology of immersive humans-with-technology environments (Levy, 1993, 1998) that supports but also disrupts and reorganizes human thinking (Borba and Villarreal, 2005). Findings - There is fruitful overlap between AI, CT and ME that is of value to consider in mathematics education. Originality/value - Seeing ME through the lenses of other disciplines and recognizing that there is a significant overlap of key elements reinforces the importance of agency, modeling and abstraction in ME and provides new contexts and tools for incorporating them in classroom practice.;133-139;2;34;English;"Artificial intelligence; Computational thinking; Artificial Intelligence; Mathematics education; Computation; Technology Integration; Computer Uses in Education; Interdisciplinary Approach; Educational Technology; Mathematics Education; Elementary School Mathematics; Middle Schools"

However, there was the complexity of technology in supporting learning activities and the gender gap issue, so an appropriate strategy is needed to guide students to achieve the learning goals. In this study, an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based robot with the ICAP model was proposed to investigate students' learning motivation, learning satisfaction, computational thinking, and gender issues while creating AI-based robots in a blended learning environment. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, this study employed the quasi-experiment. The experimental group students learned with the AI-based robot learning approach with the ICAP model, while the control group students learned with the conventional AI-based robot learning approach. The results showed that the proposed learning approach significantly improved students' intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, learning satisfaction, and computational thinking. However, there was no significant interaction between group and gender across all variables. It showed that the ICAP model successfully promoted female students to improve their intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, learning satisfaction, and computational thinking in AI-based robots. So, there was no significant difference in gender in the experimental group which employed AI-based robots with the ICAP model.;7242-7256;10;32;English;"computational thinking; PERFORMANCE; blended learning; Artificial Intelligence; Artificial intelligent; CURRICULUM; EDUCATIONAL ROBOTICS; ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL; GAME; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; IMPROVE; K-6 childhood curriculum; learning perceptions; MOBILE; Computation; Foreign Countries; Student Attitudes; Thinking Skills; Student Satisfaction; Technology Uses in Education; Learning Activities; Elementary School Students; Grade 6; Achievement Gap; Asians; Blended Learning; Course Objectives; Gender Issues; Learning Motivation; Robotics; Taiwan"

The sample consisted of 63 first-year students, divided into two groups: 31 students using ELC and 32 students using SRL. The study was conducted over a 12-hour session. The Jansen-Neyman method was utilized to analyze the interaction between pretest scores and instructional design. Results revealed a significant interaction between these instructional approaches and pretest performance, impacting learning outcomes related to logical thinking and AI anxiety. Specifically, SRL demonstrated greater efficacy in improving delayed learning achievement compared to the ELC, highlighting its importance in promoting long-term retention.

However, research on unplugged activities' influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi- experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students' mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students' CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem- posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students' mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students' interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.;;;54;English;"Computational thinking; K-12; Mathematical creativity; Mathematics; SKILLS; TASKS; Unplugged activities"

Despite this potential, there are still concerns about the interpretability and trustworthiness of AI methods. Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) not only provide interpretability and the ability to integrate data-driven insights with expert judgment for enhanced trustworthiness but also effectively process temporal dynamics and relationships in data, crucial for early predictive modeling tasks. This research introduces an approach for the temporal modeling of learners' computational thinking abilities that incorporates higher-order influences of latent variables (hereafter referred to as memory of the model) and accordingly predicts learners' performance early. Our findings on educational data from the AutoThinking game indicate that when using only first-order influences, our proposed model can predict learners' performance early, with an 86% overall accuracy (i.e., time stamps 0, 5, and 9) and a 94% AUC (at the last time stamp) during cross-validation and 91% accuracy and 98% AUC (at the last time stamp) in a holdout test. The introduction of higher-order influences improves model accuracy in both cross-validation and holdout tests by roughly 4% and improves the AUC at timestamp 0 by roughly 2%. This suggests that integrating higher-order influences into a DBN not only potentially improves the model's predictive accuracy during the cross-validation phase but also enhances its overall and time stamp-specific generalizability. DBNs with higher-order influences offer a trustworthy and interpretable tool for educators to foresee and support learning progression.;;8;14;English;"computational thinking; dynamic Bayesian network; early prediction; INTERPRETABLE AI; interpretable and trustworthy AI; KNOWLEDGE; learner modeling; STATE"

It has increasingly emerged as its own subject in all levels of education. It is a powerful cornerstone for cognitive development, creative problem solving, algorithmic thinking and designs, and programming. How to effectively teach computational thinking skills poses real challenges and creates opportunities. Targeting entering computer science and engineering undergraduates, we resourcefully integrate elements from artificial intelligence (AI) into introductory computing courses. In addition to comprehension of the essence of computational thinking, practical exercises in AI enable inspirations of collaborative problem solving beyond abstraction, logical reasoning, critical and analytical thinking. Problems in machine intelligence systems intrinsically connect students to algorithmic oriented computing and essential mathematical foundations. Beyond knowledge representation, AI fosters a gentle introduction to data structures and algorithms. Focused on engaging mental tool, a computer is never a necessity. Neither coding nor programming is ever required. Instead, students enjoy constructivist classrooms designed to always be active, flexible, and highly dynamic. Learning to learn and reflecting on cognitive experiences, they rigorously construct knowledge from collectively solving exciting puzzles, competing in strategic games, and participating in intellectual discussions.;34-49;3;7;English;"artificial intelligence; computational thinking; active learning; collaborative problem solving; constructivism in college classrooms"

While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.;;;251;English;"VALIDITY; Computational thinking; Industrial design; Learning motivation; Machine learning; QUESTIONNAIRE; RELIABILITY; SCALE; Student self-assessment; Teaching technology; TOOL"

However, students may be limited by traditional computational thinking development activities because they may have a lower degree of computational thinking efficacy for persistent learning of AI when encountering difficulties (computational thinking efficacy in learning AI). Accordingly, this study aimed to explore the relationships among Chinese secondary school students' computational thinking efficacy in learning AI, their AI literacy, and approaches to learning AI. Structural equation modeling was adopted to examine the mediation effect. Data were gathered from 509 Chinese secondary school students, and the confirmatory factor analyses showed that the measures had high reliability and validity. The results revealed that AI literacy was positively related to students' computational thinking efficacy in learning AI, which was mediated by more sophisticated approaches to learning AI, contributing to the current understanding of learning AI. It is crucial to focus on students' AI literacy and deep approaches (e.g., engaging in authentic AI contexts with systematic learning activities for in-depth understanding of AI knowledge) rather than surface approaches (e.g., memorizing AI knowledge) to develop their high-level computational thinking efficacy in learning AI.

Generative AI Drawing (GAID) offers an intuitive method for teaching AI concepts, but barriers such as restrictive access for younger students and limited instructional frameworks hinder its potential. This study proposes combining GAID with game-based learning (GBL) to create an engaging, hands-on approach for teaching CT and AI literacy. A GBL environment was developed where students designed and refined robot-control board game cards. This study involved a total of 56 sixth-grade students from two elementary schools in northern Taiwan. One group, consisting of 28 students using GAID and block-based coding to foster AI literacy, was assigned as the experimental group. The other group, consisting of 28 students who did not employ GAID but relied only on a Google search engine in their learning, was assigned as the control group. The results showed that the experimental group enhanced algorithmic thinking and AI literacy, particularly in the ""Create AI"" dimension, compared to the control group. However, the control group excelled in CT concept mastery, suggesting that the beginners need conventional learning first to better support foundational CT learning. Consequently, a balanced educational approach blending automated tools like GAID with exploratory, project-based activities is recommended to maximize learning outcomes.";21499-21518;15;30;English;"AI literacy; Computational thinking; Elementary education; Game-based learning; Generative AI"

The learning process was guided by experiential learning theory (ELT) or subject-based learning (SBL), combined with interactive gameplay. Sequential behavior pattern analysis and paired sample t-tests were conducted to evaluate the effects of ELT and SBL on learning outcomes, including improvements in learning achievement of CT and AI concepts, computer programming self-efficacy (CPSE), supervised machine learning self-efficacy (MLSE), and reductions in AI anxiety. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and the Johnson-Neyman technique were further applied to compare differences in CPSE and MLSE between the ELT and SBL approaches. The research results show that both learning approaches can increase students' CT and AI concepts in the robot GBL. The ELT is more suitable for students who initially have lower CT ability and lower self-efficacy. The stage of reflection, abstraction and operation process of ELT in implementing the AI application can enable students to generate discussion, cooperation, and direct manipulation behaviors. Those behavior patterns can enhance their CT and self-efficacy in particular for those who with low CPSE. Conversely, the SBL is more suitable for students who have advanced CT ability and high self-efficacy initially and this study revealed further discussion and suggestions for future studies.;225-240;4;28;English;"Computational thinking; SELF-EFFICACY; Game-based learning; Artificial intelligence anxiety; Behavioral patterns; Self-efficacy"

This study therefore proposed a Reflective Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) Debugging (RGD) approach, an innovative debugging approach based on reflective strategies and operationalized through a GenAI tool, an intelligent conversational agent. To assess the performance of the approach, we used a quasi-experimental design and recruited 80 high school students from two classes of a province in eastern China. One class with 40 students was selected to be the experimental group using the RGD approach; the other class with 40 students was the control group utilizing the conventional coding and debugging (CGD) approach.

Past studies show that generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can enhance students' CT skills. However, GenAI may produce inaccurate output, and students who rely too much on AI may learn little and be unable to think independently. Besides, most research on CT mainly focused on Scratch or programming classes, but incorporating it into the K-12 science curriculum is better for students' deep learning and CT core skills development. Objectives This study proposed a causal explanation and reflection (CER) model-based GenAI learning system in science courses to cultivate students' CT core skills.Sample One hundred and eighteen elementary school students in three different classes participated in this study. Methods A quasi-experiment was conducted in Fujian, China. Students in the experimental group learned with the CER model-based GenAI learning system; students learned with the CER model-based learning system in control group 1; students in control group 2 used the causal-explanation-based GenAI learning system. Students' learning achievement and CT core skills were examined. Results The results showed that the CER model-based GenAI learning system significantly improved students' science learning and CT core skills. Interview results further showed some students complained that GenAI only provided answers without encouraging them to comprehend the material. Conclusions CT should not exist only in computer courses. Instead, it is an approach to problem-solving that applies to all disciplines. Also, over-reliance on GenAI may hinder learning ability. The effectiveness of GenAI-based learning depends on its judicious use.";;5;41;English;"computational thinking; TRENDS; DESIGN; generative artificial intelligence; AI; DEEP; deep learning; GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; learning strategies; MECHANISM; REFLECTION; science education; SELF-EXPLANATIONS"

Results show that while GenAI fosters creativity and computational fluency, it simultaneously raises challenges related to epistemic vigilance, critical reflection, and project feasibility. The study concludes that pedagogically grounded integration of GenAI requires balancing automation with the cultivation of analytical, ethical, and metacognitive capacities.

Moreover, algorithmic thinking was identified as the core skill in CT development. Additionally, regarding students' HCI patterns, students with low-level CT focused on more superficial interaction patterns, such as guided and exploratory behaviors, while students with high-level CT concentrated on more in-depth interaction patterns, including debating and summarizing behaviors. Based on our findings, educators in programming should incorporate generative prompts and tailor strategies to accommodate diverse HCI patterns among students with varying CT levels.";;1;22;English;"Computational thinking; EDUCATION; Generative artificial intelligence; Prompt engineering; Human-computer interaction; Programming learning"

The computational thinking skill, which is at the core of 21st-century digital skills, has gained research in several fields, such as physics and psychology (Barkela et al., 2024). However, applied linguistics and computer-assisted language learning (CALL) have overlooked this crucial skill, which might stem from the lack of language teachers' computational thinking competency. For this reason, in the present study the researchers developed a new theoretical framework, and it's corresponding scale specifically designed for applied linguistics and CALL, namely the Language Teachers' Computational Thinking Competency in Computer Assisted Language Learning (LTCCTCALL). Using deductive and inductive methods, the researchers developed the items, followed by a validation process that used the Rasch-Andrich rating scale model (RSM) to assess the scale's item difficulty and validity using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). LTCCTCALL was validated with five factor structures that included 15 items in the Iranian EFL context, involving 273 Iranian in-service language teachers. Based on this result, the study introduced a new theoretical framework and its scale to the fields of CALL, applied linguistics, and the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) to lead the community's continued growth and to prevent the community from falling behind other fields that incorporate computational thinking skills into our classrooms to have problem-solving approaches with CALL, AI, and chatbots in language class.;;1;10;English;"21st-century digital competence; 21st-century digital skills; Computational Thinking Skill; Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL); Scale Development"

Through a qualitative case study guided by the TPACK framework, we examined 24 early childhood pre-service teachers enrolled in a mathematics methods course as they developed CT-integrated math lesson plans using AI assistance. Data sources included pre- and post-course open-ended questionnaires, CT exploration assignments, AI interaction documentation, lesson plans, and reflection papers. The findings revealed three patterns in how pre-service teachers leveraged AI as a scaffold: generating initial ideas for CT integration, refining these ideas for specific teaching contexts, and clarifying CT concepts for deeper understanding. Pre-service teachers demonstrated strategic decision-making in their AI use, successfully designing developmentally appropriate CT-integrated activities while maintaining professional judgment in content adaptation. This study highlights the critical need for structured approaches to AI integration in teacher preparation programs that effectively balance technological proficiency with pedagogical integrity. The implications suggest the importance of developing comprehensive frameworks for AI use in early childhood teacher preparation, addressing both theoretical foundations and practical implementation strategies.

However, there are few studies to date that have examined gender differences based on the learning process in a realistic classroom context. In this work, we aim to investigate gender classification using students' eye movements that reflect temporal human behavior during a computational thinking lesson in an immersive VR classroom. We trained several machine learning classifiers and showed that students' eye movements provide discriminative information for gender classification. In addition, we employed a Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) approach for feature selection and further model interpretation. The classification model trained with the selected (best) eye movement feature set using SHAP achieved improved performance with an average accuracy of over 70%. The SHAP values further explained the classification model by identifying important features and their impacts on the model output, namely gender. Our findings provide insights into the use of eye movements for in-depth investigations of gender differences in learning activities in VR classroom setups that are ecologically valid and may provide clues for providing personalized learning support and tutoring in such educational systems or optimizing system design.;929-954;4;33;English;"ROBOTICS; TECHNOLOGY; Computational thinking; EDUCATION; SCIENCE; Machine learning; ATTITUDE; CLASSIFICATION; Explainable AI; Eye movements; Gender classification; Virtual reality; Computation; Thinking Skills; Gender Differences; Technology Uses in Education; Learning Activities; Computer Simulation; Eye Movements"

There has already been a popular research trend to integrate CT into school curriculum, especially in the STEM field. However, there are still limited large scale research studies on the bidirectional relationships between primary schoolers' STEM academic achievement and CT skills, and so is language academic achievement, especially with the longitudinal research methods. This study adopted correlation analysis and cross-lagged regression analysis in a longitudinal study to separately explore the bidirectional predictive effect of STEM academic achievement, language academic achievement, and CT skills of 1,487 Chinese primary school students in grades 4-6 (11-12 years old), and explored the moderating role of gender. The results showed that there were significant bidirectional predictions between students' STEM and language academic achievements and CT skills, which further confirmed the feasibility and advantages of integrating CT in STEM and language subjects. In addition, gender only played a moderating role in the predictions of students' CT skills on their language academic achievement. Implications for reducing the gender differences in STEM and CT fields are also discussed. The research results will provide references to integrating CT into the curriculum of basic education and improving the development of primary school students' CT skills and promoting STEM teaching practice.;;;44;English;"VALIDITY; ROBOTICS; Computational thinking; K-12; GAME; SKILLS; Cross-lagged analysis; GAPS; Gender; Language academic achievement; LEARN; Moderating role; PROGRAM; STEM academic achievement"

Despite calls to extend AI literacy education from university to young students, there remains a lack of evidence-based research informing educators and researchers on the content of AI literacy education at the primary school level. This study aims to offer a comprehensive overview of what constitutes AI literacy education in primary schools, including its theoretical frameworks, pedagogical strategies, learning tools, assessment methods, educational outcomes, and challenges. The study presents a systematic review mapping process using Scopus and the Web of Science. Twenty-five empirical studies focusing on the primary school context were selected. The review revealed that (1) AI literacy encompasses a fluid conceptual understanding of digital literacy in terms of interacting and collaborating with AI, computational thinking, critical data literacy, and AI ethics; (2) constructionism, the constructivist theoretical framework, and the ARCS (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction) model of instructional design were the dominant means of constructing the research design of the selected studies; (3) constructivist methodologies, project-based learning, programming, and human-agent interaction were commonly used by the selected studies, and AI learning tools, particularly intelligent agents, were often adopted in AI literacy teaching and learning research; (4) mixed-research methods were the most common, with surveys, interviews, and artifacts being employed to evaluate students' learning outcomes; and (5) there were positive academic, affective, and behavioral educational outcomes, as well as course satisfaction. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to offer a detailed perspective on AI literacy at the primary school level, providing valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and educators designing future educational frameworks, curricula, and assessment.

This shift mirrors the rise of digital literacy in the late 20th century, positioning AI literacy as a needed skill for future generations. Despite its importance, there is ongoing debate about what exactly AI literacy entails and the skills it requires. While previous research has explored how computational thinking and varying educational levels affect AI literacy, there is a gap in related research on the impact of coding experience and the age at which students first learn about AI, especially for university students in non-computer-based majors. This exploratory study revealed that South Korean university students with prior coding experience consistently demonstrated significantly greater AI literacy than did those without prior coding experience. However, the age when students first learn about AI does not seem to play a major role in their overall perception of AI. These results suggest that the idea that coding experience might not be necessary for AI literacy needs additional investigation. However, further research is needed to fully understand the factors that contribute to AI literacy in non-computer-based university majors.;;4;16;English;"artificial intelligence; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; AI; block-coding; text-coding; university students"

Some researchers have begun examining the impact of Gen-AI, particularly on higher-order thinking (HOT), including critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, and computational thinking. Concerns exist in current discourse that Gen-AI may harm HOT. However, empirical research on the specific effects of Gen-AI on HOT remains scattered, and no consensus has been reached. This study synthesized 19 experimental and quasi-experimental studies conducted in different contexts (k = 68), involving 2,347 participants. A three-level meta-analysis was employed to account for within- and between-study variability, assessing the impact of Gen-AI on HOT and exploring the effects of moderators. The results revealed that Gen-AI had a significant positive effect on enhancing students' HOT (Hedges's g = 0.851, p < .001, 95% CI [0.452, 1.250]). Moderator analyses were conducted based on impact target, Gen-AI elements, study contexts, and methodological characteristics. When the sample size was less than 80, the promotion effect was more significant. Both short-term interventions (less than 4 weeks) and long-term interventions (more than 8 weeks) have the potential to produce significant positive effects. The meta-analysis results support the view of Gen-AI as a powerful tool for promoting students' HOT development, providing data-driven evidence for future educational practices and policymaking.;;;;English;"ChatGPT; MODELS; Generative artificial intelligence; SKILLS; AI; BIAS; Higher order thinking; Three-level meta-analysis"

The introduction of CT in primary mathematics curricula puts many demands on teachers, and their understanding of CT in mathematics is key to its successful introduction. Inspired by an information ecology perspective, we investigate how four primary school teachers understand CT in mathematics and how they go ahead to include CT in their mathematics teaching practice. Through observations and interviews, we find promising starting points for including CT, related to pattern recognition, problem solving and the use of programming activities. Our findings indicate that teachers' lack of knowledge affects CT adoption in two ways: during its inclusion in the existing mathematics curriculum and as a new element focussed on programming and coding, leaving mathematics in the background. For the inclusion to be fruitful, we suggest there is a need to help teachers understand how CT can be used productively in mathematics and vice versa.;35-46;1;36;English;"Artificial intelligence; Computational thinking; Mathematics education; Mathematics teachers; Primary school"

As a result of the analyses, the participants stated they did not feel sufficient regarding Al literacy and competencies. The participants also emphasized that using AI in preschool was appropriate and would improve children's skills, such as AI literacy and computational thinking. Moreover, they stated that using AI in preschool would cause privacy and security concerns for different reasons, such as not protecting personal data, using children's pictures, and providing false and misleading information. The participants stated that they were worried about the implementation process of Al due to lack of content knowledge, lack of infrastructure, physical structure of the classroom, and lack of materials. In addition, participants emphasized that if the existing concerns were eliminated, AI could be easily integrated into the preschool period.

It explores how sentiment analysis can measure emotional, cognitive, and behavioral involvement in learning. We developed an AI-based text sentiment analysis system to assess learning engagement, integrating speech recognition, natural language processing techniques, keyword analysis, and text sentiment analysis. The system was designed to evaluate the level of learning engagement effectively. A computational thinking curriculum and study sheets were developed for university students, and students' participation experiences were collected using these study sheets. The study utilized the strengths of SnowNLP and Jieba, proposing a hybrid model to perform sentiment analysis on students' learning experiences. We analyzed: 1, The effect of sentiment dictionaries on the model's accuracy; 2, The accuracy of different models; and 3, Keywords. The results indicated that different sentiment dictionaries had a significant impact on the model's accuracy. The hybrid model proposed in this study, utilizing the NTUSU sentiment dictionary, outperformed the other four models in effectively analyzing learners' emotions. Keyword analysis indicated that teaching materials or courses designed to promote practical, fun, and easy ways of thinking and building logic helped students develop positive emotions and enhanced their learning engagement. The most frequently occurring keywords associated with negative emotions were ""problem"", ""error"", ""not"", and ""mistake"". This finding suggests that learners experiencing challenges during the learning process-such as encountering mistakes, errors, or unexpected outcomes-are likely to develop negative emotions, which in turn decrease their engagement in learning.";;8;15;English;"artificial intelligence; TECHNOLOGY; SCIENCE; engagement; learning performance assessment; text sentiment analysis"

In this study, this research explored an experiential learning approach to improve CT along with AI application capabilities when engaging undergraduate students in creating a voice assistant application (VA app). A total of 56 students participated in the study. The control group (CG) of 26 students used a conventional subject-based learning method, while the experimental group (EG) of 30 students adopted an experiential learning method. This study aimed to examine the differences in the learning achievement of CT and AI concept, as well as the perspectives of AI anxiety, and CT; in the meanwhile, this study analysed the students' learning behaviours using sequential behavioural analysis to discuss the learning process. Results showed that the CT ability of the EG was better than that of the CG, although no significant difference was found between the two groups' AI concepts and anxiety. The behaviour analysis also revealed that the EG students were willing to ask more questions, and conducted their VA evaluation, whereas the CG students were inclined to focus on the input and output of knowledge, and replicated what the teacher presented.

The students had experienced popular speech recognition usage in their daily life, such as Siri and Google Assistant; therefore, this study developed instructional material for university freshmen to learn to develop their own artificial intelligence (AI) application (app) on a smart phone with PAC in MIT App Inventor. The PAC platform and the learning material cultivated students to train their own voice classification model, which is a form of supervised machine learning in the AI domain. The results showed that both groups, who had successfully trained computers to distinguish received voice commands with PAC receiving the human voice spectrogram via the cloud platform developed by MIT, made significant progress in their learning effectiveness in AI education. When the students employed the AI app on smartphones in the CT board game, the students' voice commands could be classified, and then the corresponding command could be executed through the program to control the action of the robot car on the map, regardless of whether they were competing or not. This study not only successfully provided the students with simple AI learning material, but also cultivated their creative thinking, as identified in the survey of the computational thinking self-efficacy scale.

Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula.

This development increasingly calls for citizens to have a basic understanding of programming and computational thinking (PCT). Accordingly, countries worldwide are implementing several approaches to integrate critical elements of PCT into K-9 education. However, these efforts are confronted by difficulties that the PCT concepts are for students to grasp from purely theoretical perspectives. Recent literature indicates that the playful nature is particularly important when novices from both both early and higher education are to learn AI. These playful activities are characterised by setting a scene where PCT concepts such as algorithms, data processing, and simulations are meant to draw on to understand better how AI is integrated into our everyday digital life. This discussion paper analyses playful PCT resources developed around the game rock-paper-scissors developed in the UK and Denmark. Resources from these countries are interesting starting points since both have been or are in the process of integrating PCT as part of the K-9 curriculum.

These learning systems are meant to reliably understand the essence of a situation and construct critical decision recommendations to support autonomous and human-machine teaming operations. In parallel, the increasing volume, velocity, variety, ve-racity, value, and variability of data is confounding the complexity of these new systems - creating challenges in terms of their development and implementation. For artificial systems supporting critical decisions with higher consequences, safety has become an important concern. Methods are needed to avoid failure modes and ensure that only desired behavior is permitted. This paper discusses an approach that promotes self-awareness, or metacognition, within the artificial intelligence systems to understand their external and internal operational environments and use this knowledge to identify potential failures and enable self-healing and self-management for safe and desired behavior.;;;151;English;"Machine learning; Artificial intelligence systems; Complexity; Metacognition; System safety"

The artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) combines artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of things (IoT) and involves integrating sensing technologies at the lowest level with relevant algorithms in order to solve real-world problems. Thus, it has now become a popular technological application for CT training. In this study, a novel AIoT learning with Augmented Reality (AR) technology was proposed and explored the effect of CT skills. The students used AR applications to understand AIoT applications in practice, attempted the placement of different AR sensors in actual scenarios, and further generalized and designed algorithms. Based on the results of the experimental course, we explored the influence of prior knowledge and usage intention on students' CT competence training. The results show that proposed AIoT learning can increase students' learning intention and that they had a positive impact on problem solving and comprehension with AR technology, as well as application planning and design.;;;12;English;"computational thinking; INTERNET; ROBOTICS; EDUCATION; artificial intelligent of thing; augmented reality; CHALLENGES; problem reasoning; problem solving skills; THINGS IOT; TOOLS"

However, little is known about the development of the literacy of CT in children, mainly because of the lack of proper psychometric assessments. We developed the first psychometrically validated assessment on the literacy of CT of children in Chinese elementary schools, coined as the Computational Thinking Assessment for Chinese Elementary Students (CTA-CES). Items were constructed to reflect key aspects of CT such as abstraction, algorithm thinking, decomposition, evaluation, and pattern recognition. To examine the test reliability and validity, we recruited two samples of 280 third- to sixth-grade students in total. Cronbach's alpha provided evidence for the reliability of the test scores, item response theory analyses demonstrated psychometric appropriateness, whereas construct validity was verified by convergent validity, and criterion-related validity was confirmed by correlations between the CTA-CES and measures related to CT, namely reasoning, spatial ability, and verbal ability. In addition, an fMRI study further demonstrated similar neural activation patterns when students conducted the CTA-CES and programming tasks. Taken together, the CTA-CES is the first reliable and valid instrument for measuring the literacy of CT for Chinese children, and may be applicable to children worldwide.;;;15;English;"artificial intelligence; computational thinking; VALIDITY; ROBOTICS; STATE; algorithm; psychometric assessment"

While computational thinking theory is still developing, empirical studies can help further understand how students demonstrate this knowledge and their progression in attaining the practices. Therefore, with this empirical study, the following questions are addressed. RQ1: What are the differences in students' computational thinking practices at the beginning of an undergraduate introductory programming course? RQ 2: How do these differences correspond to the acquisition of more advanced computational thinking practices? The use of a descriptive non-experimental design that aims to understand the correlation between practices related to data and computational problem-solving is presented. A machine learning technique is employed, utilizing historical data from introductory programming for a problem-solving course with more than 1000 first-year engineering students. After identifying groups of students defining different profiles, data from posterior performance in more advanced programming topics were descriptively analyzed. This study supports the characterization of four different student profiles demonstrating differences in their performance at the beginning of the semester. From these four profiles, two of them show a subsequent differential progression besides their similarity at the beginning of the semester. In this particular case, troubleshooting and debugging appear as a relevant competency when distinguishing these two learners' groups. These findings suggest that previous knowledge or exposure to different practices can result in different progressions of more complex computational practices, emphasizing the relevance of troubleshooting and debugging as a practice required for a successful and timely progression on the acquisition of other computational thinking practices.;33041-33050;;9;English;"SCIENCE; Problem-solving; Programming profession; TOOLS; Computational modeling; Data models; Engineering education; engineering students; Mathematical model; pattern analysis; statistical learning; Taxonomy; Tools"

There is, therefore, a growing need to measure students' learning of CT in the context of programming and also support all learners through this process of learning computational problem solving. The goal of this research is to explore hypothesis-driven approaches that can be combined with data-driven ones to better interpret student actions and processes in log data captured from block-based programming environments with the goal of measuring and assessing students' CT skills. Informed by past literature and based on our empirical work examining a dataset from the use of the Fairy Assessment in the Alice programming environment in middle schools, we present a framework that formalizes a process where a hypothesis-driven approach informed by Evidence-Centered Design effectively complements data-driven learning analytics in interpreting students' programming process and assessing CT in block-based programming environments.

In this paper, we argue that AI literacy is a foundational skill akin to reading and numeracy, and advocate for its broad integration into educational curricula beyond traditional STEM domains. Despite various initiatives promoting AI literacy in K-12 education, existing efforts predominantly focus on computational skills, excluding many underrepresented students. The paper proposes inclusive learning opportunities that decouple AI literacy from computational thinking by centering on playful activities. By investigating the implementation of a playful AI curriculum, we provide qualitative evidence that demonstrates how playful design features can offer authentic and engaging learning opportunities, even for students who might face barriers.;;;199;English;"AI Literacy; Asset-based learning; Playful design; Playful learning"

However, the actual use of and perception regarding generative AI chatbots by learners have been under-investigated. To better prepare for the future of education, it is essential to gain a more accurate understanding of learners' perceptions, particularly their trust in AI technology because trust in the technology could be closely linked to the successful adoption of these tools in educational settings. To contribute to this understanding, we examined undergraduate students' trust in generative AI chatbots used in their courses and explored the relationship between their trust levels and learning performance. Additionally, we explored the potential association between learners' trust levels, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. This research employed an exploratory study design with a regular course setting. We found that learners' trust levels were not correlated with their computational thinking, self-regulated learning, or learning performance. Furthermore, these constructs (i.e., self-regulated learning, computational thinking, and learning performance) did not significantly predict learners' trust in AI. However, there was a notable difference between high and low performers concerning changes in trust over time. Trust levels among low performers exhibited a significant change over the semester, whereas those of high performers remained relatively stable. The study suggests that expectations regarding trusting generative AI technology can be influenced by trusting intention through performance.;1445-1464;3;35;English;"TECHNOLOGY; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; Generative AI; AI-powered technology; CHATGPT; HEALTH; Human-AI interaction; IMPACT; Trust in AI; VIEW"

We study how LLM technology is used for pedagogical content creation by a sample of 25 participants in a doctoral-level Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Education course, and the role of computational-thinking skills in shaping their foraging behavior. We used editable prompt templates and socially-sourced keywords to structure their prompt-crafting process. This design influenced participants' behaviors towards exploration (to generate novel information landscapes) and exploitation (to dive into specific content). Findings suggest that exploration facilitates navigation of semantically diverse information, especially when influenced by social cues. In contrast, exploitation narrows the focus to using AI-generated content.

Conventional instructional approaches often lack interactivity and personalized scaffolding, which are essential for teaching abstract programming concepts. In response to this challenge, we examined the effect of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted problem-based learning (PBL) on students' programming skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities in Java programming. Grounded in a quasi-experimental pre-test post-test control group design, we involved 62 s-year computer science education students from two public universities in Nigeria. Participants were assigned to either an experimental group that used Google Gemini (AI) within a PBL framework or a control group exposed to PBL adopting instructional videos. We employed four validated instruments to measure computer programming skills (CPSAR), critical thinking (CTS), problem-solving (PSS), and academic ability. Using multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), we analyzed group differences while controlling for pre-test scores and tested moderation effects of academic ability and age group. Our results revealed a statistically significant improvement in programming skills among students in the AI-assisted group, with a large effect size. Critical thinking and problem-solving skill outcomes did not differ significantly between the groups. We also found a significant interaction between the teaching strategy and academic ability, indicating that high-ability students benefited more from AI integration into computer programming instruction.

Therefore, data literacy, data-driven decision making, and computational thinking should be implemented in future educational training. To evaluate the state of digital competence among young scientists (YS) in laboratory medicine, we launched a worldwide online survey. Methods: A global online survey was conducted from 25/05/2022 to 26/06/2022 and was disseminated to YS who are listed in three large networks: YS of the DGKL, the EFLM Task Group-YS, and IFCC Task Force-YS and its corresponding members, covering a base of 53 countries. Results: A total of 119 young scientists from 40 countries participated in this survey. 80 % did not learn digital skills in their academic education but 96 % felt they needed to. Digital literacy was associated with terms such as programming, artificial intelligence and machine learning, statistics, communication, Big Data and data analytics. Conclusions: The results of our survey show that more knowledge and training in the area of digital skills is not just necessary, but also wanted by young scientists.

This paper introduces the Multi-Learning-Based Reptile Search Algorithm (MLBRSA), a novel approach that synergistically integrates Q-learning, competitive learning, and adaptive learning techniques. The essence of multi-learning lies in harnessing the strengths of these individual learning paradigms to foster a more robust and versatile search mechanism. Q-learning brings the advantage of reinforcement learning, enabling the algorithm to make informed decisions based on past experiences. On the other hand, competitive learning introduces an element of competition, ensuring that the best solutions are continually evolving and adapting. Lastly, adaptive learning ensures the algorithm remains flexible, adjusting the traditional Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA) parameters. The application of the MLBRSA to numerical benchmarks and a few real-world engineering problems demonstrates its ability to find optimal solutions in complex problem spaces. Furthermore, when applied to the complicated task of software requirement prioritization, MLBRSA showcases its capability to rank requirements effectively, ensuring that critical software functionalities are addressed promptly. Based on the results obtained, the MLBRSA stands as evidence of the potential of multi-learning, offering a promising solution to engineering and software-centric challenges.

It is therefore argued that students should learn about AI, although it is debated exactly how it should be applied in education. AI literacy has been suggested as a way of defining competencies for students to acquire to meet a future everyday- and working life with AI. This study argues that researchers and educators need a framework for integrating AI literacy into technological literacy, where the latter is viewed as a multiliteracy. This study thus aims to critically analyse and discuss different components of AI literacy found in the literature in relation to technological literacy. The data consists of five AI literacy frameworks related to three traditions of technological knowledge: technical skills, technological scientific knowledge, and socioethical technical understanding. The results show that AI literacy for technology education emphasises technological scientific knowledge (e.g., knowledge about what AI is, how to recognise AI, and systems thinking) and socio-ethical technical understanding (e.g., AI ethics and the role of humans in AI). Technical skills such as programming competencies also appear but are less emphasised. Implications for technology education are also discussed, and a framework for AI literacy for technology education is suggested.;;;6;English;"AI literacy; AI in education; Ethical issues"

Therefore, this article proposes an intelligent programming scaffolding system using ChatGPT following the theoretical framework of computational thinking and scaffolding. A mixed-method study was conducted to investigate the affordance of the scaffolding system using ChatGPT, and the findings show that most students had positive attitudes about the proposed system, and it was effective in improving their computational thinking generally but not their problem-solving skills. Therefore, more scaffolding strategies are discussed with the aim of improving student computational thinking, especially regarding problem-solving skills. The findings of this study are expected to guide future designs of generative artificial intelligence tools embedded in intelligent learning systems to foster students' computational thinking and programming learning.;1668-1682;;17;English;"ChatGPT; K-12; Artificial Intelligence; Education; Problem-solving; FRAMEWORK; Programming profession; Task analysis; scaffolding; Programming; Artificial-intelligence-generated content (AIGC); Chatbots; Codes; computational thinking (CT); Encoding; INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEMS; Computation; Problem Solving; Student Attitudes; Thinking Skills; Technology Uses in Education; Natural Language Processing; Scaffolding (Teaching Technique)"

Specifically, this convergent, mixed methods case study explores the impact of employing Generative AI (GenAI) tools and cyber-social teaching methods on the development of higher education students' AI literacy. Three 8-week courses on advanced digital technologies for education in a graduate program in the College of Education at a mid-western US university served as the study sites. Data were based on 37 participants' experiences with two different types of GenAI tools-a GenAI reviewer and GenAI image generator platforms. The application of the GenAI review tool relied on precision fine-tuning and transparency in AI-human interactions, while the AI image generation tools facilitated the participants' reflection on their learning experiences and AI's role in education. Students' interaction with both tools was designed to foster their learning regarding GenAI's strengths and limitations, and their responsible application in educational contexts. The findings revealed that the participants appeared to feel more comfortable using GenAI tools after their course experiences. The results also point to the students' enhanced ability to understand and critically assess the value of AI applications in education. This study contributes to existing work on AI in higher education by introducing a novel pedagogical approach for AI literacy development showcasing the synergy between humans and artificial intelligence.;;;6;English;"Adult learning; Collaborative learning; Cooperative learning; Human-computer interface; Post-Secondary Education; Teaching/Learning Strategies"

A Meta-Analysis;JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING RESEARCH;0735-6331;10.1177/07356331241277937;The use of generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) to assist college students in their studies has become a trend. However, there is no academic consensus on whether Gen-AI can enhance the academic achievement of college students. Using a meta-analytic approach, this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of Gen-AI in improving the academic achievement of college students and to explore the effects of different moderating variables. A total of 28 articles (65 independent studies, 1909 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this study. The results showed that Gen-AI significantly improved college students' academic achievement with a medium effect size (Hedges's g = 0.533, 95% CI [0.408,0.659], p < .05). There were within-group differences in the three moderator variables, activity categories, sample size, and generated content, when the generated content was text (g = 0.554, p < .05), and sample size of 21-40 (g = 0.776, p < .05), the use of independent learning styles (g = 0.600, p < .05) had the most significant improvement in college student's academic achievement. The intervention duration, the discipline types, and the assessment tools also had a moderate positive impact on college students' academic achievement, but there were no significant within-group differences in any of the moderating variables. This study provides a theoretical basis and empirical evidence for the scientific application of Gen-AI and the development of educational technology policy.;1896-1933;7;62;English;"MATHEMATICS; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; AI; IMPACT; academic achievement; college students; generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI); instruction design; meta-analysis"

This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a '21St Century' competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problembased methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.;;;216;English;"ROBOTICS; Computational thinking; Coding; Curriculum; Early years' education; Guided inquiry; Kindergarten; Structured"

First, the study presents three levels of AIGC integration based on varying levels of abstraction. Then, drawing on extended effective use theory, the study proposes the underlying mechanism of how AIGC integration impacts programming learning performance and computational thinking.MethodsThree debugging interfaces integrated with AIGC by ChatGPT were developed for this study according to three levels of AIGC integration design. The study conducts a between-subject experiment with one control group and three experimental groups. Analysis of covariance and a structural equation model are employed to examine the effects.Results and ConclusionsThe results show that the second and third levels of abstraction in AIGC integration yield better learning performance and computational thinking, but the first level shows no difference compared to traditional debugging. The underlying mechanism suggests that the second and third levels of abstraction promote transparent interaction, which enhances representational fidelity and consequently impacts learning performance and computational thinking, as evidenced in test of the mechanism. Moreover, the study finds that learning fidelity weakens the effect of transparent interaction on representational fidelity. Our research offers valuable theoretical and practical insights. What is currently known about the subject matter? In the present information era, programming and computational thinking are important. AIGC has attracted remarkable attention from both academics and managers. If it is appropriately utilised, AIGC can facilitate education.What this paper adds Three forms of AIGC integration based on the level of abstraction, which enhance programming learning and computational thinking. Application of extended effective use theory to propose an underlying mechanism for how AIGC integration affects learning performance and computational thinking. Concrete information on the utilisation of AIGC in the education domain. Evidence that shows the importance of interaction transparency and representational fidelity for leveraging information technologies in education.Implications of the study findings for practitioners AIGC can be an effective tool for teachers, learners, and institutions. Platform designers and teachers should carefully design AICG integration.

However, there is a lack of consensus over how much experience science and engineering students have with using these tools for research-related tasks. Likewise, it is not yet known how educators and information professionals can leverage these tools to teach students strategies for information retrieval and knowledge synthesis. This study assesses the extent of students' use of AI tools in research-related tasks and if information literacy instruction could impact their perception of these tools. Responses to Likertscale questions indicate that many students did not have extensive experience using LLMs for research-related purposes prior to the information literacy sessions. However, after participating in a didactic lecture and discussion with an engineering librarian that explored how to use these tools effectively and responsibly, many students reported viewing these tools as potentially useful for future assignments. Student responses to openresponse questions suggest that librarian-led information literacy training can assist students in developing more sophisticated understandings of the limitations and use cases for artificial intelligence in inquiry-based coursework.;;4;50;English;"Generative artificial intelligence; Information literacy; CHATGPT; Critical thinking; Information retrieval; Large language models; RETRIEVAL; STEM education"
BCH2CXXR;journalArticle;2024;Liu, TX;Assessing implicit computational thinking in game-based learning: A logical puzzle game study;BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY;0007-1013;10.1111/bjet.13443;To date, extensive work has been devoted to incorporating computational thinking in K-12 education. Recognizing students' computational thinking stages in game-based learning environments is essential to capture unproductive learning and provide appropriate scaffolding. However, few reliable and valid computational thinking measures have been developed, especially in games, where computational knowledge acquisition and computational skill construction are implicit. This study introduced an innovative approach to explore students' implicit computational thinking through various explicit factors in game-based learning, with a specific focus on Zoombinis, a logical puzzle-based game designed to enhance students' computational thinking skills. Our results showed that factors such as duration, accuracy, number of actions and puzzle difficulty were significantly related to students' computational thinking stages, while gender and grade level were not. Besides, findings indicated gameplay performance has the potential to reveal students' computational thinking stages and skills. Effective performance (shorter duration, fewer actions and higher accuracy) indicated practical problem-solving strategies and systematic computational thinking stages (eg, Algorithm Design). This work helps simplify the process of implicit computational thinking assessment in games by observing the explicit factors and gameplay performance. These insights will serve to enhance the application of gamification in K-12 computational thinking education, offering a more efficient method to understanding and fostering students' computational thinking skills.Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Game-based learning is a pedagogical framework for developing computational thinking in K-12 education. Computational thinking assessment in games faces difficulties because students' knowledge acquisition and skill construction are implicit. Qualitative methods have widely been used to measure students' computational thinking skills in game-based learning environments. What this paper adds Categorize students' computational thinking experiences into distinct stages and analyse recurrent patterns employed at each stage through sequential analysis. This approach serves as inspiration for advancing the assessment of stage-based implicit learning with machine learning methods. Gameplay performance and puzzle difficulty significantly relate to students' computational thinking skills. Researchers and instructors can assess students' implicit computational thinking by observing their real-time gameplay actions. High-performing students can develop practical problem-solving strategies and exhibit systematic computational thinking stages, while low-performing students may need appropriate interventions to enhance their computational thinking practices. Implications for practice and/or policy Introduce a practical method with the potential for generalization across various game-based learning to better understand learning processes by analysing significant correlations between certain gameplay variables and implicit learning stages. Allow unproductive learning detection and timely intervention by modelling the reflection of gameplay variables in students' implicit learning processes, helping improve knowledge mastery and skill construction in games. Further investigations on the causal relationship between gameplay performance and implicit learning skills, with careful consideration of more performance factors, are expected.;2357-2382;5;55;English;"PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; SCIENCE; SKILLS; FRAMEWORK; computational thinking assessment; data science applications; game-based learning analytics; GAMIFICATION; GUIDELINES; implicit computational thinking behaviours; learning behaviour patterns; SERIOUS GAME"

However, contemporary programming education is hindered by fragmented course content, high complexity, and difficulties in maintaining engagement, impeding smooth progress. More effective collaborative learning strategies need to be explored. This study constructed jigsaw-integrated task-driven learning (jigsaw-TDL) in a high school Python programming course under a STEM curriculum and verified its teaching effectiveness on students' learning motivation, computational thinking, collaborative skills, and programming performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. Nighty-nine high school students were randomly assigned to a jigsaw-TDL group and a general collaborative task-driven learning group (collaborative-TDL). During the experiment, a Python programming course was introduced over 7 weeks. Questionnaires, programming tasks, and semistructured interviews were comprehensively applied to examine students' learning outcomes. Finally, the jigsaw-TDL group showed significantly better performance than the collaborative-TDL group in learning motivation, computational thinking, and collaborative skills. However, it only led to better programming performance in the less complex tasks. The majority of students held a positive attitude toward the jigsaw-TDL model, acknowledging its benefits in group collaboration, programming knowledge acquisition, and application. This research provides empirical evidence and potential guidance for task organization and collaborative learning support in programming courses and STEM education.;;6;32;English;"EDUCATION; K-12; collaborative learning; high school; jigsaw integrated task-driven learning; Programming education"

The purpose of this study was to fill a gap in the current review of research on AI in science education (AISE) in the early stage of education by systematically reviewing existing research in this area. This systematic review examined the trends and research foci of AI in the science of early stages of education. This review study employed a bibliometric analysis and content analysis to examine the characteristics of 76 studies on Artificial Intelligence in Science Education (AISE) indexed in Web of Science and Scopus from 2013 to 2023. The analytical tool CiteSpace was utilized for the analysis. The study aimed to provide an overview of the development level of AISE and identify major research trends, keywords, research themes, high-impact journals, institutions, countries/regions, and the impact of AISE studies. The results, based on econometric analyses, indicate that AISE has experienced increasing influence over the past decade. Cluster and timeline analyses of the retrieved keywords revealed that AI in primary and secondary science education can be categorized into 11 main themes, and the chronology of their emergence was identified. Among the most prolific journals in this field are the International Journal of Social Robotics, Educational Technology Research and Development, and others. Furthermore, the analysis identified that institutions and countries/regions located primarily in the United States have made the most significant contributions to AISE research. To explore the learning outcomes and overall impact of AI technologies on learners in primary and secondary schools, content analysis was conducted, identifying five main categories of technology applications.

With the advancement of the machine learning-based research approach, there are reports that some machine learning algorithms outperform logistic regression models in terms of prediction. In this study, we collected cognitive, affective, and demographic data from 4,142 primary students as features to predict their understanding of computational thinking (CT) concepts. We identified and used five popularly used machine learning models. All five machine learning models outperformed the logistic regression model, with the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model achieving the highest predictive accuracy. We used these features and the K-means algorithm of the unsupervised clustering technique to identify four optimal clusters of students. By comparing the representative students from each of the four clusters, selected by the t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding algorithm, we found that each cluster had its characteristics. For example, one cluster consisted of students who outperformed students in the other three clusters in mathematics, scored highest in prior experience in programming, and used computers and the Internet most frequently. By identifying the characteristics of these clusters, pedagogical design, and resource support can be proposed to support students' learning of CT concepts.;7647-7660;10;32;English;"Artificial Intelligence; Programming; Clustering; computational thinking concepts; machine learning-based approach; PROGRAMMING EMPOWERMENT; t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding; XGBoost model; Computation; Thinking Skills; Instructional Design; Algorithms; Elementary School Students; Predictor Variables; Computer Uses in Education; Accuracy; Comprehension; Internet; Multivariate Analysis; Prediction; Student Characteristics"

Various strategies have been planned and developed to help in introducing, improving, and delivering CT. One of the strategies is by creating and developing the supporting tools for CT learning. In this article, educational robotics (ER) is chosen as the focus tool to support CT learning. Each CT and ER has a massive field of study. There are various available reports determining the suitability of CT subject integrated with ER for students' learning. However, all students do not develop similar style of learning and thinking. There is difference in their personal traits. There is a lack of research that designed CT learning through ER specifically based on student's preferences. Besides, it resulted in a challenge to determine the suitability of CT and ER for different kind of preferences. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an adaptive learning (AL) framework for students to deliver learning of CT through ER. The framework consists of three submodels: domain model, student model, and adaptation model. One case study is defined, which is learning the introductory level of CT through ER (CTER). At the end of the study, it can be observed that the AL framework produced positive results in performance and perception for various student categories. It was noted that students utilizing the AL framework had superior understanding of CTER.

We provide visualization and evaluation techniques to find hidden patterns in the students' solutions which allow teachers to predict the specific behavior of students or to prevent some student mistakes or misconceptions in advance or further pedagogical intervention. Background: Formal concept analysis is a method of unsupervised Machine Learning that applies mathematical lattice theory to organize data based on objects and their shared attributes. Several fuzzy extensions of formal concept analysis have a great potential to visualize and evaluate students' solutions, to categorize the solutions into overlapping biclusters (formal concepts) or to generate the attribute implications between extracted attributes. Research Question: Does formal concept analysis describe the various solutions and the relationships between the extracted attributes of students' solutions in the educational and computational thinking game Light-Bot? Methodology: Targeting the evaluation of 64 students' solutions in the Light-Bot game, we construct the formal contexts of the extracted attributes. We apply formal concept analysis to construct the concept lattices from two binary formal contexts and to generate attribute implications and their fuzzy counterparts to find the dependencies between the extracted attributes. Findings: The results of our paper provide a description of various students' solutions which are visualized in the concept lattices. 1) Regarding the concept lattice of binary formal contexts, we obtained the characterization of the largest biclusters which includes a description of the largest group of similar solutions. 2) The attribute implications mainly reveal the characterization of similar solutions, e.g., with a higher count of executed commands in solutions. 3) Using fuzzy attribute implications, we obtained the characterization of solutions with unnecessary commands, going out of the game area, or using indirect recursion.;20-32;1;68;English;"Artificial Intelligence; Education; Programming profession; Attribute implications; CONCEPT LATTICES; formal concept analysis; Formal concept analysis; Games; Lattices; light-bot; Lighting; Robots; visualization; Problem Solving; Game Based Learning; Visual Aids; Educational Games; Evaluation Methods; Pattern Recognition; Student Behavior"

The rapid development of AI technologies has highlighted the need for educators to develop AI-related skills and competencies in order to meaningfully integrate these technologies into their professional practice. A pilot study was conducted using a self-assessment questionnaire developed from frameworks such as DigiCompEdu and the Selfie for Teachers tool. The study aimed to explore the relationships between AI literacy competence and already defined digital skills and competencies through principal component analysis (PCA). The results revealed distinct components of AI literacy and digital competencies, highlighting competence overlaps in some areas, for example, digital resource management, while also confirming that AI literacy competencies form a separate and essential category. The findings show that although AI literacy aligns with other digital skills and competencies, focused attention is required to professionally develop AI-specific competencies.

This study examines AI literacy among university students, examining variables such as gender, frequency of use of AI applications, completion of AI-related courses, and field of study. The research involved 664 students from a public university, using a survey model and data collected via the Artificial Intelligence Literacy Scale. Descriptive and decision tree analyses, specifically the CHAID algorithm, were used to determine the factors influencing AI literacy levels. The results showed that the students' overall AI literacy, critical aprasial and practical application were average and technical understanding was low. While the frequency of individuals' use of AI technology has a determining effect on the overall AI literacy scale and critical appraisal(CA) and practical applications(PA) dimensions, gender came to the fore in the technical understanding(TU) dimension. The overall scale, PA and CA, while the status of having taken a course in AI is effective for students who frequently use artificial intelligence tools, the type of faculty of study is effective for those who use it less frequently. In TU, the faculty of study for females and the frequency of using artificial intelligence tools for males are determinative. While the TU scores of male students are higher than those of female students, the AI literacy of students studying in the faculties of science and literature, engineering, technology and medicine are higher than those of students studying in the faculties of education, sports sciences and postgraduate students.;6765-6784;5;30;English;"Artificial intelligence; EDUCATION; Artificial intelligence literacy; Decision tree method; Higher education; University students"

Most studies investigated computational thinking development as a function of learners' factors, instructional strategies and learning environment. However, the influence of the wider community such as educational policies on computational thinking remains unclear.ObjectivesThis study examines the impact of basic and technology-related educational policies on the development of computational thinking.MethodsUsing supervised machine learning, the computational thinking achievements of 31,823 eighth graders across nine countries were analysed. Seven rule-based and tree-based classification models were generated and triangulated to determine how educational policies predicted students' computational thinking.Results and conclusionsPredictions show that students have a higher propensity to develop computational thinking skills when schools exercise full autonomy in governance and explicitly embed computational thinking in their curriculum. Plans to support students, teachers and schools with technology or introduce 1:1 computing have no discernible predicted influence on students' computational thinking achievement.ImplicationsAlthough predictions deduced from these attributes are not generalizable, traces of how educational policies affect computational thinking exist to articulate more fronts for future research on the influence of educational policies on computational thinking. What is already known about this topic Computational thinking (CT) is a problem-solving skill. Inquiries on CT focus on learners' factors such as age, gender and attitudes. Also, the choice of instructional strategies and learning environment influence CT development.What this paper adds Articulated how the wider community structures influence the development of CT. Educational policies affect the development of computational thinking.Implications for practices Students have a higher predicted propensity to develop CT when schools exercise full autonomy in governance and embed CT in the curriculum explicitly.

These skills are basic pillars of Computational thinking (CT) and are essential for a computer programmer. Therefore, a programming teacher needs to take these skills into account for the evaluation of students. Existing methods for improving programming competency don't consider the Computational Thinking of students and perform grading of students without taking these skills into account. Due to this limitation, deficiencies of these skills in students remain unrevealed, posing difficulties for educators to provide need-oriented feedback. The performance of programming students is thus hindered by a lack of interventions. This study proposes a method to evaluate programming students in terms of CT skill components and group them based on their skill set. In this study, 780 students of object-oriented programming (OOP) class were given programming assignments for assessment of programming competencies. These students were then given small programming tasks requiring different computational thinking skill components for their solutions. A machine learning approach was used to perform grouping of these students based on their scores. Six groups of programming students, each having its own set of skill deficiencies, were identified as a result of clustering. One of the groups had an empty set of skill deficiencies and consisted of students proficient in programming. Each of the other five groups had a non-empty set of skill deficiencies and comprised non-proficient programming students. A group-specific skill development plan was built for the groups having skill deficiencies. It was found that such feedback was very effective and improved the CT skill deficiencies of 82% of students.;59431-59440;;12;English;"programming; Education; Machine learning; Programming profession; Task analysis; Programming; Codes; Clustering algorithms; Cognitive systems; Computational thinking assessment; feedback; Feedback; K-means clustering; Object oriented programming; Performance evaluation; Source coding"

The curriculum was designed with an awareness of the practical challenges encountered by the subject school in their implementation of AI education, while also adhering to the guidelines for AI curriculum outlined in the General Senior High School Curriculum Standards: Information Technology. Building on this foundation, the curriculum objectives were proposed. The curriculum modules were meticulously developed, informed by the insights gained from student surveys and interviews with teachers. Subsequently, a teaching experiment was implemented in a high school, employing a combination of engaging lectures and project-based learning methodologies. Following this, a quasi-experiment was conducted to investigate variations in students' computational thinking. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, which included an examination to assess students' mastery of AI-related concepts and theories, project evaluation forms to investigate and evaluate students' computational thinking processes, and a questionnaire to statistically analyze students' satisfaction with the curriculum. Through these measures, the effectiveness of the school-based AI curriculum was verified from multiple perspectives. The results confirmed the curriculum's effectiveness in enhancing students' computational thinking, particularly in algorithmic thinking, cooperativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. When compared to traditional AI teaching methods based on the Information Technology curriculum, the school-based AI curriculum demonstrated a more pronounced effectiveness in cultivating these competencies, with students showing significant improvements in problem analysis, solving, and knowledge transfer, alongside high satisfaction levels. This study provided a compelling case of school-based AI education in senior high schools, expecting to inspire educators' teaching practice in AI education and to catalyze the development of computational thinking across K-12 learning environments.;7949-7993;6;30;English;"VALIDITY; Artificial intelligence; Computational thinking; Artificial Intelligence; Artificial intelligence education; Case study; Curriculum design; Computation; High School Students; Problem Solving; Skill Development; Thinking Skills; Teaching Methods; Technological Literacy; Active Learning; Algorithms; Cooperation; Critical Thinking; Curriculum Design; Information Technology; Mastery Learning; Program Effectiveness; Secondary School Curriculum; Student Projects; Student Satisfaction; Technology Uses in Education"

This article presents a methodology for teaching robotics based on AI-generated contexts aimed at enhancing CT. An experiment was conducted with 122 undergraduate students enrolled in an Early Childhood Education program, aged 18-19 years, who were training in the Computer Science and Digital Competence course. The experimental group utilized a methodology involving AI-generated practical assignments designed by their lecturers to learn educational robotics, while the control group engaged with traditional teaching methods. The research addressed five key factors: the effectiveness of AI-generated contexts in improving CT skills, the specific domains of CT that showed significant improvement, the perception of student teachers regarding their ability to teach with educational robots, the enhancement in perceived knowledge about educational robots, and the overall impact of these methodologies on teaching practices. Findings revealed that the experimental group exhibited higher engagement and understanding of CT concepts, with notable improvements in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. Participants in the AI-generated context group reported increased confidence in their ability to teach with educational robots and a more positive attitude toward technology integration in education. The findings highlight the importance of providing appropriate context and support when encouraging future educators to build confidence and embrace educational technologies. This study adds to the expanding research connecting AI, robotics, and education, emphasizing the need to incorporate these tools into teacher training programs.

Yet, CT is often assessed through results, rather than by looking at the CT process itself. Process-based assessments, or assessments that model how a student completed a task, could instead investigate the process of CT as a formative assessment. In this work, we proposed an approach for developing process-based assessments using constructionist tasks specifically for CT assessment in K-12 contexts, with a focus on directly connecting programming artifacts to aspects of CT. We then illustrated such an assessment with 29 students who ranged in CT and programming experience. These students completed both a constructionist task and a traditional CT assessment. Data from the constructionist task was used to build a process-based assessment and results were compared between the two assessment methods. The process-based assessment produced groups of students who differed in their approach to the task with varying levels of success. However, there was no difference between groups of students in the scores on the traditional CT assessment. Process-based assessment from our approach may be useful as formative assessment to give process feedback, localized to the task given to students.;157-173;2;11;English;"computational thinking; learning analytics; formative assessment; LEARNING ANALYTICS; Process-based assessments; Learning Analytics; Computation; Thinking Skills; Secondary School Students; Algorithms; Elementary School Students; Feedback (Response); Pattern Recognition; Student Evaluation; Efficiency; Task Analysis"

However, few studies deepen the process of learning ML and CT. This exploratory study aims to investigate the impact of ML activities on the CT skills of secondary school students. The participants consisted of 20 students enrolled in the 5th grade at a public secondary school. Data from interviews and screen recordings were analyzed and scored using a rubric developed by the researchers. The results indicated that the activities positively contributed to the development of abstraction, decomposition, algorithm design, and pattern recognition dimensions of CT. The study's findings are noteworthy because they show how ML differs from traditional approaches to teaching CT in terms of concepts, learning paths, and problem-solving techniques. Both the practical application of ML and the educational goal of advancing CT to make it appealing and informative for educators who are interested in integrating ML in computer science education for young students are also included. We hope that the findings of this study will assist in designing and implementing ML activities for young students.;9547-9571;7;30;English;"Computational thinking; Artificial Intelligence; Computer science education; MACHINE learning; Computation; Student Attitudes; Thinking Skills; Secondary School Students; Experiential Learning; Grade 5; Learning Activities; Public Schools"

The study aims to investigate the impact of an educational course on AI on the comprehension of concepts, literacy, and empowerment in the field of AI among students of higher educational institutions. The experiment involved 125 students from Hohai University in China. As a result of taking the training course, students were able to improve their understanding of concepts (increasing their average score from 6.33 to 9.69), literacy (from 2.94 to 3.99), and empowerment (from 3.90 to 4.04) in AI. The resulting data statistically confirmed the effectiveness of the developed course for improving confidence in the field of AI. The training module can be applied to improve confidence in the field of AI for students in various careers, as information competence is important these days and increases the success of graduates in employment. When it comes to further research, the encouraging results of this study suggest opportunities for promoting this training program among a diverse group of participants. To confirm the effectiveness of the developed course, it can be conducted among students in schools and other educational institutions, reducing it to even more basic if necessary.;;1;33;English;"digital technology; information literacy; information technology; learning artificial intelligence"

In response to the increasingly formidable challenges faced by secondary school teachers, this study endeavors to analyze and explore the application of artificial intelligence (AI) methods to enhance their cognitive literacy. Initially, this discourse delves into the application of AI -generated electronic images in the training and instruction of middle school educators, subjecting it to thorough analysis. Emphasis is placed on elucidating the pivotal role played by AI electronic images in elevating the proficiency of middle school teachers. Subsequently, an integrated intelligent device serves as the foundation for establishing a model that applies intelligent classification and algorithms based on the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO). This model is designed to assess the cognitive literacy and teaching efficacy of middle school educators, and its performance is juxtaposed with classification algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM) and decision trees. The findings reveal that, following 600 iterations of the model, the SVM algorithm achieves a 77% accuracy rate in recognizing teacher literacy, whereas the SOLO algorithm attains 80%. Concurrently, the spatial complexities of the SVM-based and SOLO -based intelligent literacy improvement models are determined to be 45 and 22, respectively. Notably, it is discerned that, with escalating iterations, the SOLO algorithm exhibits higher accuracy and reduced spatial complexity in evaluating teachers' pedagogical literacy. Consequently, the utilization of AI methodologies proves highly efficacious in advancing electronic imaging technology and enhancing the efficacy of image recognition in educational instruction.;;;10;English;"Artificial intelligence; EDUCATION; Electronic imaging; Image recognition; OUTCOMES; SOLO classification; Teacher's intelligent literacy"

The study addresses the gap in practical guidance for incorporating AI literacy by developing and implementing a 10-week AI-integrated EAP module at a pathway college in Scotland based on a novel framework termed AI for Academic Purposes (AIAP). Utilising a mixed-methods approach, the research investigates the impact of this module on international students' attitudes, confidence, and purposes of using AI tools. Results of this study indicate significant improvements in students' ability to critically evaluate GenAI output, confidence in using a greater variety of AI tools, understanding of ethical AI use, and an expansion in the purposes for which students use AI tools. The integration of AI literacy with traditional EAP skills was found to meet students' academic needs effectively. This study provides a replicable model for integrating AI literacy into EAP courses, offering a holistic educational approach that aligns technological proficiency with ethical awareness.

Specifically, the authors sought to understand the level of AI literacy among university students, the extent of their prior exposure to AI education, and the factors that affect their AI education. The study was conducted through an online survey distributed among 300 university students at a Korean university. The study findings indicate that most university students are interested in learning AI. Moreover, the results showed that students with prior experience with software (SW) education showed superior knowledge, a better grasp of AI concepts, and more confidence in using AI technologies, especially in computer coding skills. On the other hand, students with less exposure to prior AI education expressed a need for more learning opportunities and sufficient knowledge of computer coding skills. In addition, we found that students who had received SW education during their K-12 schooling showed better math skills than those who had only received short-term training in university. These findings underscore the importance of addressing the educational barriers that impede university students' ability to harness this interest effectively. In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into university students' perceptions regarding AI literacy and the factors that affect their AI education.;;3;14;English;"AI education; AI literacy; higher education; AI; university students; DIGITAL LITERACY"

The indications of the Digicomp framework and 21st-century skills in Europe have outlined the key competences for lifelong learning needed for all citizens, including teachers and students. In this perspective, Education plays a fundamental role in ensuring that citizens acquire the required skills. The objective in the common European framework is clear: to initiate a transition from the culture of knowledge to the culture of competence. Nowadays, technological advancement allows the researchers to create and combine different frameworks with the perspective of an even more tailored, and engaged education, some examples derived from the implementation of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), in the combination of Gamification and AI, or the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to foster and create an even more personalized learning and teaching. Following these premises, in this paper, we want to point out new research reflections and perspectives that could help researchers, teachers, educators (and consequently students) to reflect on the introduction of new technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, robot tutors) and on how these can affect on human behavioral development and on the acquisition of new skills and competences (Specifically: Creativity, Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Computational Thinking) for the educational context. The analysis carried on, suggests a perspective on how creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving can be effective in promoting computational thinking, and how Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be an aid instrument to teachers in the fostering of creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving in schools and educational contexts.;;;148;English;"Artificial intelligence; Education; Competencies; Robot tutors"

Many researchers around the world have conducted studies to define CT, to develop CT in students, and to assess CT using various tools and paradigms. Our review focuses on the assessment aspect of CT using digital games. Typically, the assessment in CT is done using Multiple Choice Questions, Portfolio analysis, pen-and-paper methods, and games. The use of video games to assess CT skills was one of the least explored areas. To further explore this area, we did a systematic literature review on the use of video games to assess CT. The findings of our review are as follows: (1) CT skills such as abstraction, algorithmic thinking, data representation, debugging, decomposition, pattern recognition, recursive thinking, simulation, socialization, heuristic, iteration, and problem-solving were primarily assessed using digital games. (2) The reviewed articles used samples ranging from 18 to 3355 participants. (3) The sample includes elementary, middle-, and high-school and graduate students. (4) In the reviewed articles, it is observed that the time for treatment varied from a few hours to the entire school year. (5) A mixed-mode study using quantitative and qualitative methods was preferred by researchers to explore the CT aspects such as CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. (6) The use of video games, stealth assessment, educational data mining and machine learning for assessing CT skills is in a dormant state.

This makes it challenging to determine how different departments of students are affected by them. This study draws on research in programming education and STEM education to explore the different factors that affect students in AI learning. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of AI learning platforms on information undergraduate and non-information undergraduate by using a research model. The course was implemented for 65 students in the information undergraduate group and 39 students in the non-information undergraduate group.

To address these challenges, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be introduced as a supportive tool to enhance both the efficiency and outcomes of collaborative programming. In this shift, the structure of collaborative teams evolves from human-to-human to a new paradigm consisting of human, human, and AI. To investigate the effectiveness of integrating LLMs into collaborative programming, this study designed a quasi-experiment. To explore the effectiveness of integrating LLMs into collaborative programming, we conducted a quasi-experiment involving 82 sixth- and seventh-grade students, who were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. The results showed that incorporating LLMs into collaborative programming significantly reduced students' cognitive load and improved their computational thinking skills. However, no significant difference in self-efficacy was observed between the two groups, likely due to the cognitive demand students faced when transitioning from graphical programming to text-based coding. Despite this, the study remains optimistic about the potential of LLM-enhanced collaborative programming, as students learning in this way exhibit lower cognitive load than those in conventional environments.;;1;12;English;

Children were divided into two groups: one exposed to an AI robot for 6 months and the other for 18 months. Data were collected through assessments of children's AI literacy and computational thinking, as well as interviews with eight teachers and eight parents.ResultsThe initial exposure group showed an improvement on the perceived intelligence dimension of AI literacy. Children in both initial exposure and extended exposure groups increased computational thinking over time. Teachers and parents noted that interactions with AI robots promoted cognitive skills and knowledge, such as problem-solving and technology familiarity. However, they also expressed concerns about the potential impacts of AI on holistic development.ConclusionThis study highlights the developmental benefits and challenges of AI robots in early childhood education for underserved populations.ImplicationsSuch efforts are essential to ensure equitable opportunities for all children, contributing to school success and preparing them for a future society where AI is prevalent in daily life.;1354-1375;3;74;English;"computational thinking; early childhood education; AI literacy; AI robots; parent experience with AI education"

Debugging code is a central skill for students, but is also a considerable challenge when learning to program. Learners at the K-12 level often lack confidence in programming debugging due to a lack of effective learning feedback and programming fundamentals (e.g., correct syntax usage). With the development of technology, large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for novice programming debugging training. We proposed a method for incorporating an LLM into programming debugging training, and to test its validity, 80 K-12 students were selected to participate in a quasi-experiment with two groups to test its effectiveness. The results showed that through dialogic interaction with the model, students were able to solve programming problems more effectively and improve their ability to solve problems in real-world applications. Importantly, this dialogic interaction increased students' confidence in their programming abilities, thus allowing them to maintain motivation for programming learning.;259-278;2;28;English;"Computational thinking; Generative artificial intelligence; Artificial Intelligence; Self-efficacy; Programming; Coding; SCHOOL; Large language models; Programming education; OUTCOMES; COMMUNICATION; CONSTRUCTION; Debugging skills; DIALOGUE; MISTAKES; Computation; Student Attitudes; Thinking Skills; Secondary School Students; Instructional Effectiveness; Elementary School Students; Self Esteem; Student Motivation"

In order to explore the interactive mechanism and influencing factors between AI literacy and computing thinking level of high school students in H city, this study focuses on the relationship between student background, AI literacy, and computational thinking. By conducting a questionnaire survey of hundreds of high school students and using SPSS for descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and correlation analysis, the focus is on exploring the impact and interrelationships between the three dimensions of AI literacy and the five dimensions of computational thinking. A structural equation model (SEM) was constructed by using AMOS software to further explore its internal complex correlation relationship. The results show that parental education and daily use of AI tools significantly affect students' AI knowledge and skills, while factors such as gender and family location have different degrees of positive or negative effects on creativity, algorithmic thinking, and critical thinking. In addition, artificial intelligence literacy is moderately positively correlated with some dimensions of computational thinking.

Several countries and institutions have attempted to concretize CT in the schools' curricula. This paper presents the integration of CT into mathematics (Math + CT) lessons utilizing specific mathematics software, GeoGebra. Through the educational design research (EDR), we innovated our Math + CT lessons by integrating ChatGPT to generate GeoGebra commands. Five adults and 16 junior high school students participated in this study. We collected the data from participants' ChatGPT prompts and screen video recordings. The data were mainly analyzed through a content analysis method. The findings revealed that ChatGPT has limitations in generating GeoGebra commands but provided opportunities to develop students' CT skills.

The aim of the study is to predict the computational thinking skills of middle school students through ANFIS approach, which is an adaptive neural network-based fuzzy logic. Students' computational thinking skill scores were predicted by creating a model based on grade level and academic achievement variables. Grade level and academic achievement served as the model's input variables, and computational thinking skill scores served as the model's output variable. Data were collected using personal information form and computational thinking scale. A comparison was made between students' real and artificial computational thinking skill scores using statistical methods. In the study, a strong and favorable association between the artificial scores produced using the ANFIS technique and the actual scores was discovered. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference between the real and artificial scores for computational thinking skills. These results indicate that the ANFIS approach is a suitable alternative analysis method for predicting students' computational thinking skills.

Background In the present and future of education, developing computational thinking is strategic for the digital age, serving as a bridge between technology and problem-solving. There is an opportunity to look for new ways to promote computational thinking because people have difficulty abstracting real problems and applying decomposition methods, design patterns, and algorithmic thinking in various complex contexts. Methodology The ADDIE framework (analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation) was applied to develop an escape room with learning analytics and challenges focused on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). The application was carried out with 119 participants from the science club.Contribution This research provides practical specifications for developing digital escape rooms that implement learning analytics. This study is of great value to academics, developers, and decision-makers interested in developing training activities that promote high-level skills for dealing with complexity. Findings The physical and logical models created can guide the implementation of requirements and database creation when developing educational digital escape rooms. A timeline, event history analysis, and a method examining the sequence of discrete states can measure computational thinking development and identify other high-level competencies in educational digital escape rooms. Essential features of web-based educational digital escape rooms include an adaptive design for optimal visualization and interaction, accessibility across a variety of devices, easy navigation, and challenges that include puzzles and time-limited problems. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers Suggestions for practitioners who want to enhance high-level competencies include: (a) employ challenge-based strategies like an educational digital escape room, (b) gradually increase the difficulty of challenges to monitor competency development, (c) control the time students spend solving puzzles, and (d) continuously evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the educational digital escape room for ongoing improvement. Researchers who want to develop high-level competencies through educational digital escape rooms should consider timelines, event history analysis, and a method that scrutinizes the students' sequence of discrete states while answering questions, which allows effective progress tracking. Impact on Society This study contributes to open education by creating quality open educational resources for the development of high-level competencies.

However, there is a noticeable gap in research focusing on the micro-level development patterns of learners' CT and ST and their interconnections.ObjectivesThis study aims to uncover the intricate development patterns and interrelations between learners' CT and ST at a micro level within a robot programming environment.MethodsThirty middle school students participated in the study and completed SOLO robot programming tasks. Process data on their online programming behaviour were collected through programming platform log data, screen recordings and synchronised think-aloud audio, while result data were obtained through CT and ST standardised tests. The data were then analysed using cluster analysis, process mining techniques, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman analysis.Results and ConclusionsThe results revealed three clusters of learner types (i.e., masters, debuggers and beginners). Masters skilfully employed both CT and ST, while debuggers effectively activated ST through feedback. Beginners, however, showed lower proficiency in both. Notably, their CT structures demonstrated bidirectional thinking, top-down systematic programming and bottom-up debugging methods. The intrinsic developmental structure of ST shifted from direction language to spatial behaviour. Furthermore, ST and CT were mutually enhanced and mental rotation in ST is positioned as a foundational skill for CT.ImplicationsThese findings contribute to a deeper understanding of learners' intrinsic thinking processes and offer essential guidance for optimising programming education.;;2;41;English;"computational thinking; PERFORMANCE; CURRICULUM; LEARNING ANALYTICS; multimodal learning analytics; robot programming environment; spatial thinking; thinking development"

However, despite being extensively studied over the last few decades, research on their associations has only emerged recently. We report on a study that examined how creativity is manifested in the context of CT, specifically while solving computational problems in an online game-based learning environment for early programming. We took a learning analytics log-based approach to evaluate measures of CT and creativity. We developed a Python algorithm to automatically analyze the logged solutions across four creativity measures. This allowed for an objective, quantitative, multidimensional analysis of 52,438 submissions of N = 111 primary and secondary school students over 85 tasks. We examined the relationships between measures of creativity, game level, and CT, utilized exploratory analysis to investigate how measures of creativity differ across age groups, and explored how these measures characterize students. Our findings suggest that creativity does not decrease throughout the game despite the increased difficulty and its mechanics that penalize creative solutions. We also point out how various dimensions of creativity play different roles in learning. These findings suggest that educators should foster intrinsic motivation and encourage students to explore multiple solution paths to enhance both CT and creativity skills. Researchers should keep investigating mechanisms to assess and enhance creativity in learning environments and explore the influence of personal and contextual factors.;;1;15;English;"computational thinking; K-12; STUDENTS; learning analytics; computational creativity; game-based learning environments"

This study uses behavioural data from the interactive Bebras Challenge task to assess CT skills, offering a deep analysis of the problem-solving process beyond final binary outcomes. The dataset of solutions (N = 336) from an interactive CT task, focusing on recorded behavioural data, such as object interactions, decision sequences, colour choices and time taken to complete the task, was analysed. Machine learning algorithms were applied to cluster the solutions, identifying distinct patterns that reflected different problem-solving strategies. The analysis went beyond binary classification, revealing variations in solution approaches within successful and unsuccessful attempts, allowing for a more detailed assessment of CT skills. The findings from this study suggest a scoring system based on identified solution clusters as a more refined assessment of CT compared to existing binary methods.

While previous studies have shown that self-explanation can enhance students' learning, few empirical studies have examined the effects of using different self-explanation prompts to cultivate students' CT skills. Objectives This study aimed to investigate the effects of self-explanation on students' CT skills and programming behaviours. Methods Using a quasi-experimental design, 60 7th-grade students were recruited to participate in a 5-week programme. They were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a group that received scaffolded self-explanation prompts (n = 20), a group that received open-ended self-explanation prompts (n = 20) or a control group that received no self-explanation prompts (n = 20). A series of analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were conducted to explore the effects of self-explanation on learning CT skills, and lag sequential analysis (LSA) was used to examine the behavioural patterns and traits exhibited by participants in these three groups throughout the programming learning process. Results and Conclusions The results revealed that the students in the experimental groups (i.e., both the scaffolded and the open-ended self-explanation groups) exhibited significantly better CT skills than did those in the control group. Additionally, the students in the experimental groups exhibited more logical and systematic thinking behaviours (e.g., explanations, conclusions, operational simulations and predictions) than did those in the control group.

However, there are few available scales for assessing AI literacy in university students that are deeply grounded in a theoretical model. Thus, this study aims to develop and validate a questionnaire for use in the Chinese higher education context. Based on Bloom's Taxonomy and existing relevant literature, we proposed a five-construct structure with 63 items for this scale. Using survey data from 386 participants, we employed an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine the underlying factorial constructs. A further sample of 401 participants underwent a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the latent domains, reliability, and validity of the structure. The findings significantly identified an updated AI literacy model with five dimensions, namely AI knowledge, AI application, AI attitude, AI ethics, and AI innovation. This first scale with clear capacity categories for measuring Chinese university students' levels of AI literacy is regionally unique. It could contribute to the advancement of AI literacy in research, as well as the evaluation of students' knowledge and skills and the promotion of effective usage in practice.;;;;English;"AI literacy; higher education; SCALE; assessment development; DIMENSIONS; scale validation"

Despite growing integration of AI technologies in classrooms, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding how these tools influence the development of essential 21st-century skills in secondary education contexts. This study addresses this gap by investigating the relationships between generative AI applications and two critical student outcomes: innovation capability and digital literacy. Through structural equation modeling analysis of data collected from 500 students across grades 7-12, the research reveals three key findings: Firstly, generative AI applications demonstrate a substantial positive effect on students' innovation capability (beta = 0.862, p < .001), enhancing critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and adaptive learning processes. Secondly, AI integration significantly improves digital literacy (beta = 0.835, p < .001) by facilitating sophisticated information processing and active technological engagement. Thirdly, a strong bidirectional relationship exists between innovation capability and digital literacy (beta = 0.791, p < .001), suggesting these competencies mutually reinforce each other in AI-enhanced learning environments. The model demonstrates robust explanatory power with excellent fit indices. By integrating the Technology Acceptance Model with Diffusion of Innovations theory, this study advances theoretical understanding of AI's educational impact while providing practical guidelines for educators. The findings underscore the importance of strategic AI integration in educational curricula and suggest specific pathways for developing critical student competencies in the digital age.;;5;20;English;"VALIDITY; TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL; ADOPTION; COMPETENCE; CREATIVITY"

This study aims to determine the capacity of GenAI to generate effective computer programming learning in STEM university students, comparing it with active learning methods based on video. An experiment was conducted with 40 computer engineering students divided into two groups: one using GenAI (Google Gemini 1.5) and another employing educational videos. Pre- and post-tests of knowledge and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) were applied to evaluate learning, intrinsic motivation, and the learning environment. No significant differences in learning were found between the groups. However, GenAI significantly increased perceived autonomy and reduced perceived effort and pressure, while video-based learning significantly improved perceived competence.

However, there is little effort to develop adaptive educational computer games for promoting students' computational thinking (CT). In this study, an adaptive computer game is introduced, called AutoThinking, that not only promotes both CT skills and conceptual knowledge, but also provides adaptivity in both game-play and learning processes. To evaluate the possible effects of the game, an experimental study was carried out with 79 students in an elementary school in Estonia. AutoThinking and a conventional technology-enhanced learning approach were used for teaching CT to the experimental and control group, respectively. Our results reveal that AutoThinking improved students' CT skills and conceptual knowledge better than the conventional approach. It was also found that students with a low and high level of prior knowledge made higher improvement in knowledge gain using the adaptive game compared to the traditional approach, especially those students with lower prior knowledge. Finally, our findings show that the adaptive game could also improve students' learning attitude toward CT better than the conventional approach, especially those students with higher prior learning attitudes.;;;114;English;"PERFORMANCE; SERIOUS GAME; Adaptive learning; Adaptive educational computer game; Adaptive game-play; Computational thinking knowledge and skills"

Problem-based learning (PBL) helps develop deep engagement with the reading materials and higher-order reading skills. However, conventional PBL (C-PBL) activities ignore differences in students' cognitive levels and fail to provide timely and targeted feedback and guidance to each student. As a result, many students are unable to actively engage in PBL-based reading activities. To address these problems, this study proposes a personalized two-tier PBL (PT-PBL) approach based on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). It provides a more personalized and refined design for PBL activities to promote personalized reading learning for students. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach, 62 college students participated in a quasi-experiment, with the PT-PBL approach in the experimental group and the C-PBL approach in the control group. The results indicate that the PT-PBL approach significantly improves students' reading performance and motivation. In addition, compared to students with lower engagement, this approach is more effective at improving the reading performance of highly engaged students. Interviews with students showed that those who used the PT-PBL approach focused more on reading tasks and reflected more frequently. The main contribution of this study is proposing a novel PT-PBL approach and providing empirical evidence of its effectiveness, while also creating opportunities for future research to further explore the positive impact of GenAI on reading.;;1;12;English;"INQUIRY; IMPACT"

CBEFHA3R;journalArticle;2025;"Gškdemir, G; Kayan, HZ";Artificial intelligence as a linguistic interface in interior design education: Reconceiving design tools as communication media;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL COMPUTING;1478-0771;10.1177/14780771251352955;The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has fundamentally transformed the role of design tools, extending their function beyond conventional applications to become linguistic interfaces that mediate and structure cognitive and communicative processes in design. This study critically examines the reconfiguration of AI-driven design tools within interior design education, foregrounding their role as discursive agents in design communication. Through an in-depth analysis of an AI-based workshop conducted with interior design students, the research investigates how linguistic engagements with AI systems influences decision-making, conceptualization, and procedural methodologies within the design process. The findings reveal a shift from traditional design heuristics toward a linguistically embedded computational paradigm, elucidating how AI-generated textual and visual interactions inform cognitive schemata and foster epistemic innovation in design education. The study argues that AI-driven design tools not only enhance visualization capabilities but also act as cognitive co-agents that refine and articulate linguistic constructs within design discourse. By proposing an integrative framework for embedding language-oriented AI applications into interior design pedagogy, this research advances a reconceptualization of digital design engagement and advocates for a deeper integration of computational linguistics into design cognition and practice.;;;;English;"Artificial intelligence; CREATIVITY; computational literacy; design cognition; design tools; interior design education; linguistic interaction; scenario-based learning"
TZNTC7WU;journalArticle;2025;Kavashev, Z;Using artificial intelligence in the development of self-determined lifelong learners in higher education: a scoping review;JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN HIGHER EDUCATION;1042-1726;10.1007/s12528-025-09463-3;The rapid emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is profoundly reshaping teaching and learning practices in higher education. This shift challenges traditional pedagogical approaches and increasingly requires learners to develop autonomy, adaptability, and lifelong learning skills. As this trend accelerates, it becomes essential to understand how AI-driven tools and teaching approaches are being used to promote self-determined learning. However, the use of AI technologies to support the development of lifelong learning skills in self-determined learners is still in its early stages, underscoring the need for further investigation into existing learning environments. Therefore, this scoping review investigates AI-driven tools and approaches for the development of self-determined lifelong learning skills. This is the first scoping review to present and synthesize self-determined lifelong learning skills within the implementation of AI-driven learning environments. The results suggest that AI-driven technologies predominantly develop self-determined lifelong learning skills and competencies such as learner agency, self-efficacy and capability, metacognition and reflection, responsibility, digital competence, critical thinking, collaborative learning, problem-solving, employability, and self-regulated learning but do not sufficiently draw on non-linear learning and learning how to learn skills. In addition, computational thinking, with its scarcity among other skills and competencies, holds significant promise for future research on the development of self-determined lifelong skills. University instructors, instructional designers, and future employers can draw on these insights to collaborate and integrate AI-driven technologies to enhance the development of self-determined lifelong learners.;;;;English;"Artificial intelligence; AI; HEUTAGOGY; Learning environments; Lifelong learning; Self-determined learning; Skills development"

In this study, we attempt to answer the following questions: (1) What can we learn about young people's understanding of AI when they produce media with and about it? and (2) What are the design features of an ethics-centered pedagogy that promotes STEM engagement via AI? To answer these questions, we co-developed and documented three projects at YRMedia, a national network of youth journalists and artists who create multimedia for public distribution. Participants are predominantly youth of color and those contending with economic and other barriers to full participation in STEM fields. Findings showed that by creating a learning ecology that centered the cultures and experiences of its learners while leveraging familiar tools for critical analysis, youth deepened their understanding of AI. Our study also showed that providing opportunities for youth to produce ethics-centered interactive stories interrogating invisibilized AI functionalities, and to release those stories to the public, empowered them to creatively express their understandings and apprehensions about AI.";;3;22;English;"artificial intelligence; computational thinking; TECHNOLOGY; machine learning; engagement; CHILD; agency; ART; Critical pedagogy; ethics-centered; media; ONE LAPTOP; PEDAGOGY"

One new technology that is heatedly discussed is artificial intelligence (AI) in education. To allow students to understand the impact of emerging technologies on people's future lives from a young age, some popular science activities are being progressively introduced into elementary school curricula. Popular science activities are informal education programs and practices of universal education. However, two issues need to be discussed in the implementation of these activities. First, because these informal curricula are usually short in duration, the question of whether they only serve to generate motivation or actually enhance learning outcomes requires examination. Second, the role of teacher support in popular science activities and its impact on students' learning results need to be further investigated. To this end, this study aims to explore the effectiveness of popular AI science activities in informal curricula on students' AI achievement and the interrelationship between students' learning outcomes in popular AI science activities with and without teacher support. A 6-h-long AI popular science activity was conducted with 22 fifth- and sixth-grade students in elementary school. This study was conducted using a one-group pretest and posttest design, and the data collection tools included AI achievement pre- and posttests and an artifact scoring rubric. The results showed that with regard to learning outcomes, popular science activities were helpful for cognitive enhancement of AI concepts, but more time was needed for skills to improve. Additionally, this study found that students' learning performance was different with and without teacher support. Activities with teacher support can enhance students' learning outcomes, but students become accustomed to relying on their teachers. In contrast, activities without teacher support seem to be more effective in fostering students' independent computational thinking and problem-solving abilities.;;;13;English;"artificial intelligence; STEM education; SCHOOL STUDENTS; ENGAGEMENT; informal curriculum; MATH; popular science activities; teacher support; universal education"

This study applied secondary document analysis and case study to identify five pedagogical indicators for teaching and learning computational thinking, including technology, pedagogical approaches, assessment techniques, data aspect, and teacher professional development. Based on the pedagogical indicators, this study proposed a computational thinking pedagogical assessment framework (CT-PAF) aimed at supporting educators with a strategy to assess the different technological learning tools in terms of pedagogical impact and outcome. Furthermore, three case-study instructional tools for teaching CT in K-12 were analyzed for the initial assessment of CT-PAF. Scratch, Google Teachable Machine, and the iThinkSmart minigames were marched to the underpinning characteristics and attributes of CT-PAF to evaluate the framework across the instructional tools. The initial assessment of CT-PAF indicates that the framework is suitable for the intended purpose of evaluating technological instructional tools for pedagogical impact and outcome. A need for expanded assessment is, therefore, necessary to further ascertain the relevance of the framework in other cases.;;;7;English;"computational thinking; ROBOTICS; EDUCATION; K-12; machine learning; SKILLS; SCHOOL; SCRATCH; evaluation framework; Google Teachable Machine; instructional tools; iThinkSmart minigames; Scratch; WIKI"

However, most existing games have focused on the theoretical knowledge of computational thinking, ignoring the development of computational thinking skills. Moreover, there is a lack of integration of adaptivity into educational computer games for computational thinking, which is crucial to addressing individual needs in developing computational thinking skills. In this study, we present an adaptive educational computer game, called AutoThinking, for developing students' computational thinking skills in addition to their conceptual knowledge. To evaluate the effects of the game, we conducted an experimental study with 79 elementary school students in Estonia, where the experimental group learned with AutoThinking, while the control group used a traditional technology-enhanced learning approach. Our findings show that learning with the adaptive educational computer game significantly improved students' computational thinking related to both conceptual knowledge and skills. Moreover, students using the adaptive educational computer game showed a significantly higher level of interest, satisfaction, flow state, and technology acceptance in learning computational thinking.

Particularly, effective assessment of computational thinking can support the understanding of how learners develop computational concepts and practices. Aiming to help advance research on this topic, we propose a data-driven approach to assess computational thinking concepts, based on the automatic analysis of data from learners' computational artifacts. As a proof of concept, the approach was applied to a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) to investigate the course's effectiveness as well as to identify points for improvement. The data analyzed consists of over 3300 projects from the course participants, using the Scratch programming language. From that sample, we found patterns in how computational thinking manifests in projects, which can be used as evidence to guide opportunities for improving course design, as well as insights to support further research on the assessment of computational thinking.;33-54;1;21;English;"computational thinking; EDUCATION; K-12; computer science education; SCRATCH; LEARNING ANALYTICS; automatic assessment tools; CODE; online learning"

Scientific Reasoning, Critical Thinking, and the ability to debunk myths are already important competencies that can be fostered with science education. How can we approach the majority of seventh grade students in a given school to create innovative approaches for the future, and leverage their skills in science, art and (digital) technology along the path? And are the teachers ready to guide them on this path? This article focuses on the questions: how did the teachers adopt both the STEAM approach, and the use of digital tools while being supervised by researchers and student teachers and how did this change their beliefs about technology in education. As a pathway, we aimed to connect Robotics, Coding, Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. To end poverty, protect the environment, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030, the SDGs are incorporated into national policies and school curricula. With this, citizens, teachers, and governments alike struggle with strategies on how these goals can be reached by 2030, facing the growing challenges in an ever increasingly complex and insecure world. It is clear that technology will take a dominant role in this development. Based on the STEAM paradigm and the 5E approach of the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS), we have developed a pedagogical concept that encompasses both the technological aspects, AI and the SDGs. We tested this concept as part of an on-the-job teacher training project with 60 education science student teachers and 8 teachers in their classrooms, together with their 116 7th grade students and found out that STEAM-based projects with a sixth phase in addition to the 5E approach can be carried out promisingly with the help of digital creativity tools. We found that the 5E model with an additional sixth phase is well suited for bringing STEAM into the classroom.;;;7;English;"computational thinking (CT); robotics; Piaget; STEAM; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); teacher-education; Vygotski"

In addition, much of the research on CT has focused on creating generally agreed-upon definitions and curricula, but few studies have empirically tested assessments or used contemporary learning sciences methods to do so. In this paper, we outline the implementation of an assessment approach for a 10-day high school biology unit with computational thinking activities that examines student pre-post responses as well as responses to embedded assessments throughout the unit. Using pre-post scores, we identified students with both positive and negative gains and examined how each group's CT practices developed as they engaged with the curricular unit. Our results show that (1) students exhibited science and computational learning gains after engaging with a science unit with computational models and (2) that the use of embedded assessments and discourse analytics tools reveals how students think differently with computational tools throughout the unit.;136-160;1;29;English;"ROBOTICS; Computational thinking; K-12; Assessment; EXPLORATION; Learning analytics; Biology; Science learning"

Nevertheless, the implementation of CT in school curricula is still in an experimental stage, given that different performance metrics remain unclear, including the appropriate age for learning each skill, the significant and achievable computational concepts for each school year, teaching strategies, learning effectiveness, and strategies for assessing development. Based upon constructivist problem-solving learning strategies and supported by a three-dimensional framework, a game-based environment with both individual and collaborative playing modes has been developed as a learning and an assessment tool via learning analytics. Moreover, an exploratory case study has been carried out involving 176 primary school students. Results suggest that this environment is suitable as a learning and assessment tool for CT skills in primary school, providing enduring learning, particularly when it engages the collaborative playing mode. It seems to be better adapted to early primary school stage students, who showed greater improvements and who were able to assimilate more computational concepts than expected. Likewise, special needs or low percentile students benefit even more greatly from the learning tool and especially from the collaborative playing mode.

Those students divided into two groups, the students participating in the experimental group were using the AR system with deep learning recommendation and the students participating in the control group were using the AR system without deep learning recommendation. The results show that students in experimental group perform better than the control group with regards to learning achievement. On the other hand, in the part of computational thinking ability, students using a deep learning recommendation based AR system is significantly better than those using non-deep learning recommendation based AR system. Among the various dimensions of computational thinking, creativity, logical computing, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills are significantly different among the two groups of students.

Students require an incentive to acquire any new skill. This can be accomplished by employing gamification, which has been widely used in educational environments and instructional practices to improve student engagement and motivation by including game elements. However, delivering CT to students through gamification is challenging. There is a lack of studies on integrating gamification into CT, especially when it comes to considering student preferences such as learning styles. Besides, according to the reviews, the existing adaptive frameworks do not directly incorporate gamification and CT into education. Therefore, the author proposed an adaptive gamified framework that supports adaptive features based on students' dimensions (verbal, visual) using the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM) to foster CT skills and enhance students' motivation and performance using a modified version of the Moodle platform that supports adaptive learning features. The proposed framework integrates an ""adaptive gamification framework"" with the ""student-centered framework"" by adopting the available gamification elements in the ""student-centered framework"". Additionally, it matches the results with the proposed conceptual model that investigates the relationship between gamification and CT in the field of education to provide adaptive gamification and learning features. Furthermore, the results of the work indicated that the use of gamification had a positive impact on students in terms of motivation and performance, as the game elements contributed to increasing children's desire to retake the tests and thus improved the performance of students.";89-100;3;17;English;"Computational Thinking; Gamification; Adaptive; E-Learning; Game Elements; Learning Style; Moodle; Motivation"

The lack of understanding of key aspects of pandemics has affected virus transmission. On the other hand, there is a demand to incorporate computational thinking (CT) in the curricula with applications in STEM. However, there are still no exemplars in the curriculum that apply CT to real-world problems such as controlling a pandemic or other similar global crises. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing exemplars of CT for modeling the pandemic. We designed exemplars following the three pillars of the framework for CT from the Inclusive Mathematics for Sustainability in a Digital Economy (InMside) project by Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC): algorithmic thinking, computational modeling, and machine learning. For each pillar, we designed a progressive sequence of activities that covers from elementary to high school. In an experimental study with elementary and middle school students from 2 schools of high vulnerability, we found that the computational modeling exemplar can be implemented by teachers and correctly understood by students. We conclude that it is feasible to introduce the exemplars at all grade levels and that this is a powerful example of Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) integration that helps reflect and tackle real-world and challenging public health problems of great impact for students and their families.;;23;18;English;"computational thinking; COVID-19; computational modeling; lesson study"

Data were analyzed from a standardized creativity test (Torrance's TTCT) and cross-referenced with log files that documented the students' activities in the Kodetu game-based learning environment. Our research findings indicate some interesting associations between CT and Creativity. First, we found that creativity contributes to CT. Second, we found that CT is transferable across different domains. Finally, we found that Computational Creativity can develop and improve over time.";926-959;5;59;English;"computational thinking; INFORMATION; VALIDITY; TECHNOLOGY; learning analytics; GAME; SKILLS; FRAMEWORK; Programming; creativity; LEARNING ANALYTICS; CHILDRENS CREATIVITY; TORRANCE TESTS; computational creativity; 21ST-CENTURY; log analysis; Creativity; Learning Analytics; Correlation; Foreign Countries; Problem Solving; Thinking Skills; Computer Science Education; Creative Thinking; Game Based Learning; Grade 6; Middle School Students; Spain; Creative Development; Creativity Tests; Preadolescents; Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking; Transfer of Training"

Learning how to program not only enables learners to develop computing applications, but it can also enhance learners' computational thinking (CT) practice. CT refers to learners' ability to approach ill-structured tasks systematically based on algorithmic thinking in computing. Along with growing academic interests towards CT in recent studies, researchers have emphasized the role of teaching programming in facilitating learners' problem-solving skills. Emerging OERs have expanded learners' opportunities to engage in hands-on programming exercises; yet a challenge still remains as to how learners' programming exercises can be tailored to accommodate individual differences in terms of learners' digital literacy skills. There is still a lack of in-depth discussions on how to support learners' personalized learning experiences during programming exercises associated with CT. This study hence proposes a conceptual framework that seeks to consider how to promotelearners' personalized learning experiences and enhance their CT skills in OERs. Through extensive reviewing of literature, this study provides several implications for further research.";;1;7;English;"Computational Thinking; EDUCATION; Learning Analytics; LEARNING-SYSTEM; Open Educational Resource; Personalization"

Emphasizing on CT applied in both programming and everyday contexts, we developed a humanoid robotics curriculum and a computerized assessment instrument. We implemented the curriculum with six classes of 125 fifth graders. Quantitative methods were used to compare students' performance from pretest to posttest. Learning analytics techniques were applied to examine students' problem solving processes. The results showed that students' CT performance improved in both programming and everyday reasoning contexts and that the curriculum benefited students with varied initial performance.

However, including computational thinking into science instruction may be challenging. Therefore, for biological evolution (an essential theory within biology that spans across temporal and organizational scales), we recommend integrating computational thinking into evolution teaching to overcome misconceptions, reinforce the nature of science (NOS), and allow student embodiment (as students become emerged in their models, i.e., personification). We present a learning progression, which outlines biological evolution learning coupled with computational thinking. The defined components of computational thinking (input, integration, output, and feedback) are integrated with biology student roles. The complex nature of both teaching computational thinking and biological evolution lends toward a learning progression that identifies instructional context, computational product, and computational process and spans from simple to complex. Two major themes of biological evolution, unity and diversity have each been paired with both computational thinking and specific corresponding NGSS standards at levels of increasing complexity. There are virtually no previous studies which relate computation and evolution across scales, which paves the way for questions of importance, support, benefits, and overall student achievement in relation to the advancement of science in education.;1035-1077;4;29;English;"MATHEMATICS; STUDENTS; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; SELF-EFFICACY; PRIOR KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE-EDUCATION; COMPLEX-SYSTEMS; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; SENSE EXCEPT; TEACHING EVOLUTION"

However, students from different ethnic groups often have different learning responses to such lessons due to their respective cultural backgrounds, the environment in which they grew up, and their consideration for future employment. In this study, an AI-assisted programming module was developed and used to compare the differences between multi-ethnic college students in terms of their theoretical and actual learning expectancy, motivation, and effectiveness. The module conducted analysis through the deep learning network and examined the relevant processes that the students underwent during programming lessons, as well as the types of errors they had committed. Their learning motivation for and actual learning performance in programming were then examined based on the cognitive learning theory. The results of the experiment, which involved 96 multi-ethnic college students, indicated that the two groups had dissimilar theoretical performance in terms of their expectancy and motivation for learning programming. The indigenous students' main concern was whether programming would affect their families or tribes, and this concern affected and was reflected in their learning outcomes. In contrast, the learning motivation and goals of Han Chinese students were driven by the cognition of the value of programming to themselves. The research findings can contribute toward the cognition and understanding of multi-ethnic students when learning computer programming and development of the appropriate teaching methods, and serve as a reference for subsequent research on integrating multiculturalism into computer programming lessons.;;;13;English;"STRATEGIES; EDUCATION; K-12; TEACHERS; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; ACHIEVEMENT; AI-assisted program; ATTITUDES; CANADA; expectancy-value theory; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY LITERACY; learning effectiveness; multiculturalism; program education"

One such breakthrough technologies is Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning algorithms. Nowadays, the public has little understanding of the workings and implications of AI techniques that are already entering their lives in many ways. We aim to achieve widespread public understanding of these issues in an experiential learning framework. Following a design based research approach, we propose to implement program coding scaffoldings to teach and experiment some basic mechanisms of AI systems. Such experiments would be shedding new light into AI potentials and limitations. In this paper we focus on innovative ways to introduce high school students to the fundamentals and operation of two of the most popular AI algorithms. We describe the elements of a workshop where we provide an academic use-create-modify scaffolding where students work on the Scratch partial coding of the algorithms so they can explore the behavior of the algorithm, gaining understanding of the underlying computational thinking of AI processes. The extent of the impact on the students of this experience is measured through questionnaires filled before and after participation in the workshop. Preliminary experiments offer encouraging results, showing that the workshop has differential impact on the way students understand AI.;179027-179036;;7;English;"MATHEMATICS; Artificial intelligence; SCIENCE; Education; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; Programming profession; Tools; DESIGN-BASED RESEARCH; public AI awareness; PUBLIC TRUST; Scratch programming; teaching AI fundamentals; Conferences"

Gaming and interactivity have been suggested as essential features in reducing dropout and increasing persistence in online learning. Yet in interactive game-based learning environments, persistence in moving forward in the game may come at the expense of investing in each of the game's levels. That is, the motivation to complete the game may have a deleterious effect on learning at specific levels and hence on learning from the game in general. Therefore, we have chosen to focus on microlevel persistence (i.e., persistence during each component of the learning process). We study microlevel persistence in the context of acquiring computational thinking-the thought process of solving problems through abstraction-which is a key component of the new literacies needed for tomorrow's citizens. In this study, we analyze data collected from an online, game-based learning environment (CodeMonkey (TM)). The data document the activity of first to sixth graders (N = 2,040). Overall, we find that persistence is positively associated with difficulty and that the most determined learners were highly persistent across topics in achieving the best solution.;891-918;5;58;English;"computational thinking; PERFORMANCE; ABILITY; SCIENCE; learning analytics; SKILLS; FRAMEWORK; Programming; INSTRUCTION; MOTIVATION; ENGAGEMENT; game-based learning; log analysis; persistence; computer-aided instruction; Learning Analytics; elementary school; RATES; Foreign Countries; Problem Solving; Thinking Skills; Game Based Learning; Elementary School Students; Difficulty Level; Concept Formation; Children; Efficiency; Age Differences; Computer Games; Instructional Program Divisions; Israel; Persistence"

In this paper we introduce an open educational approach of artificial intelligence (AI) for everyone. Through a hybrid and participative MOOC we aim to develop a critical and creative perspective about the way AI is integrated in the different domains of our lives. We have built and now operate a MOOC in AI for all the citizens from 15 years old. The MOOC aims to help understanding AI foundations and applications, intended for a large public beyond the school domain, with more than 20,000 participants engaged in the MOOC after nine months. This study addresses the pedagogical methods for designing and evaluating the MOOC in AI. Through this study we raise four questions regarding citizen education in AI: Why (i.e., to which aim) sharing such citizen formation? What is the disciplinary knowledge to be shared? What are the competencies to develop? How can it be shared and evaluated? We finally share learning analytics, quantitative and qualitative evaluations and explain to which extent educational science research helps enlighten such large scale initiatives. The analysis of the MOOC in AI helps to identify that the main feedback related to AI is ""fear"", because AI is unknown and mysterious to the participants.

Implications about designing CT courses for pre-service teachers are discussed. Background: CT is an essential 21st-century competency that supports the development of problem-solving skills. Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers' coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants' reflections. In one section of an undergraduate Introduction to Educational Technology course offered at a large university in Western Canada, n=139 pre-service teachers wrote a short reflection on their experience following a 20 h Accelerated Intro to Computer Science Code.org course. Topics were identified by analyzing contextual trends in participants' written reflections. Findings: Results showed that pre-service teachers' reflections included CT concepts, practices, and perspectives.

With the creation of K-12 computer science standards by the Computer Science Teacher Association, states such as Massachusetts and Washington are leading the nation in adopting these standards into their school systems. This seems somewhat premature, when there are so few measures of computational thinking or computer programming skills that can be applied easily in a K-12 setting to assess outcomes of such state- wide initiatives. Through funding from the National Science Foundation, we developed an analysis tool to efficiently capture student learning progressions and problem-solving activities while coding in Scratch, a popular visual programming language developed by MIT Media Lab. Our analysis tool, the Functional Understanding Navigator! or FUN! tool, addresses the need to automate processes to help researchers efficiently clean, analyze, and present data. We share our experiences using the tool with Scratch data collected from three different week-long summer Scratch Camps with students in grades 5 to 8. Based on our preliminary analyses, we share important considerations for researchers interested in educational data mining and learning analytics in the area of assessing computational thinking. We also provide links to the publically available FUN! tool and encourage others to participate in a community developing new measures of computational thinking and computer programming.;;;;English;"Computational thinking; K-12; Learning analytics; Educational data mining"

Using a qualitative research design, the study employed semi-structured interviews to collect data from 13 teachers from five countries. The data were then analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings of the study indicated that the use of AI has the potential to both expand and regress teacher leadership. AI can expand teacher leadership by providing tools for personalization, curriculum development, automating administrative tasks, and supporting professional development. However, AI was also viewed to be regressing teacher leadership, by narrowing the role because technology was taking over some of its aspects. Five sets of competencies were suggested by teachers for teacher leaders to sustain their roles in an AI era. The study concludes that the impact of AI on teacher leadership depends on how it is implemented and integrated into the education system. It highlights the importance of continued research and training in this area to inform future education policies and practices.;8415-8433;7;29;English;"VALIDITY; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; Artificial intelligence (AI); Education technology; Teacher leadership"

However, pedagogical design for AI literacy remains a critical challenge, especially for upper elementary students aged 10-12. Aims: This design-based study had two goals: to develop a pedagogical approach for AI literacy in upper elementary education and to empirically assess this approach through an experiment. Sample: One hundred forty-seven sixth graders in an upper elementary school were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 75) and an experimental group (n = 72). Methods: Following a theory-informed design convention, we proposed a dual-contrast pedagogical (DCP) approach. This approach centers on human-AI comparisons by integrating analogies and cognitive conflicts. Two teaching examples on machine learning and large language models were provided. The experimental group was taught with the DCP approach, while the control group received conventional direct instruction. Data drawn from assessment tasks and questionnaires were subjected to two-way analyses of variance and covariance. Results: The experimental group demonstrated significantly higher performance in AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. They also exhibited a significant increase in AI learning confidence and intrinsic motivation and a significant decrease in learning anxiety. Conclusions: The DCP approach significantly improved students' learning performance and attitudes, demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting AI literacy.

However, their educational potential is limited in practice due to challenges such as the following: (i) the difficulties in incorporating symbolic educational knowledge (e.g., causal relationships and practitioners' knowledge) in their development, (ii) a propensity to learn and reflect biases, and (iii) a lack of interpretability. As education is classified as a 'high-risk' domain under recent regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act-highlighting its influence on individual futures and discrimination risks-integrating educational insights into ANNs is essential. This ensures that AI applications adhere to essential educational restrictions and provide interpretable predictions. This research introduces NSAI, a neural-symbolic AI approach that integrates neural networks with knowledge representation and symbolic reasoning. It injects and extracts educational knowledge into and from deep neural networks to model learners' computational thinking, aiming to enhance personalized learning and develop computational thinking skills. Our findings revealed that the NSAI approach demonstrates better generalizability compared to deep neural networks trained on both original training data and data enriched by SMOTE and autoencoder methods. More importantly, we found that, unlike traditional deep neural networks, which mainly relied on spurious correlations in their predictions, the NSAI approach prioritizes the development of robust representations that accurately capture causal relationships between inputs and outputs. This focus significantly reduces the reinforcement of biases and prevents misleading correlations in the models. Furthermore, our research showed that the NSAI approach enables the extraction of rules from the trained network, facilitating interpretation and reasoning during the path to predictions, as well as refining the initial educational knowledge. These findings imply that neural-symbolic AI not only overcomes the limitations of ANNs in education but also holds broader potential for transforming educational practices and outcomes through trustworthy and interpretable applications.;593-618;1;6;English;"machine learning; learner modeling; CLASSIFICATION; explainable and trustworthy AI; knowledge extraction; neural-symbolic AI; personalized learning"

However, the openness and adaptability of programming languages present unique challenges for instructional practices compared to other subjects. While traditional instructional tools offer limited support, ChatGPT, a groundbreaking Generative Artificial Intelligence, has shown impressive capabilities in natural language processing and knowledge generation. This study explored whether ChatGPT can transcend existing limitations and improve programming education through a quasi-experimental approach with post-hoc interviews in high school classrooms. A total of 153 students participated, and the results from MANCOVA and ANCOVA analyses revealed that students using ChatGPT reported lower levels of flow experience, self-efficacy, and learning achievement compared to those utilizing conventional methods. Post-hoc interviews further revealed that students felt ChatGPT's effectiveness in facilitating their programming learning fell short of their initial expectations.

To date, there is little evidence of AI methods supporting students' collaboration in complex, open-ended environments. AI systems are known to underperform humans in (1) interpreting students' emotions in learning contexts, (2) grasping the nuances of social interactions and (3) understanding domain-specific information that was not well-represented in the training data. As such, combined human and AI (ie, hybrid) approaches are needed to overcome the current limitations of AI sys-tems. In this paper, we take a first step towards investigating how a human-AI collaboration between teachers and researchers using an AI-generated mul-timodal timeline can guide and support teachers' feed-back while addressing students' STEM+C difficulties as they work collaboratively to build computational models and solve problems. In doing so, we present a framework characterizing the human component of our human-AI partnership as a collaboration between teachers and researchers. To evaluate our approach, we present our timeline to a high school teacher and discuss the key insights gleaned from our dis-cussions. Our case study analysis reveals the effectiveness of an iterative approach to using human-AI collaboration to address students' STEM+C chal-lenges: the teacher can use the AI-generated time-line to guide formative feedback for students, and the researchers can leverage the teacher's feedback to help improve the multimodal timeline. Additionally, we characterize our findings with respect to two events of interest to the teacher: (1) when the students cross a difficulty threshold, and (2) the point of intervention, that is, when the teacher (or system) should intervene to provide effective feedback. It is important to note that the teacher explained that there should be a lag between (1) and (2) to give students a chance to re-solve their own difficulties. Typically, such a lag is not implemented in computer-based learning environ-ments that provide feedback.;595-620;2;56;English;"K-12; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; multimodal learning analytics; CIRCUMPLEX MODEL; human-AI collaboration; K12 education; MMLA; STEM plus C learning; teacher supports; timeline dashboard"

Secondary students were particularly wellsuited for comprehensive AI education due to their cognitive characteristics and developmental readiness. While most studies have focused on developing pedagogy, curriculum, and tools for secondary AI education, they have prioritized measuring students' learning outcomes over literacy development. Referring to the empirical research on secondary AI education as well as Piaget's Epistemology and Bloom's Taxonomy, this study figured out a KAT framework that constitutes AI literacy: (1) AI Knowledge (AI fundamentals, elements of AI technology, application of AI technology), (2) AI Affectivity (AI and human, AI and society), and (3) AI Thinking (engineering design thinking, computational thinking). Based on this, a 57-item AI literacy scale (AILS) was developed, and 56 items were retained after expert judgement. Then, a large sample of Chinese secondary students was surveyed, resulting in 1392 valid samples, which were randomly divided into two sub-samples: 720 samples were used for item reduction through Rasch Analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis; 672 samples were used for model validation and comparison through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Results indicated the AILS with three-factor structure of 48 items has a good reliability and validity. Moreover, gender differences in AI literacy among secondary students were examined. Results indicated that boys had significantly higher AI Knowledge than girls, whereas girls had significantly higher AI Affectivity than boys. The implications, limitations and future research were also discussed.";;;227;English;"MATHEMATICS; PERFORMANCE; SCHOOL-STUDENTS; FUTURE; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; Information literacy; SKILLS; COMPETENCE; 21st century abilities; Evaluation methodologies; FIT INDEXES; GENDER-GAP; Secondary education"

However, traditional teaching methods fall short in motivating students and fostering higher-order thinking and have difficulty providing a personalized learning experience. Although AI chatbots can provide instant feedback as an innovative teaching tool, it is still challenging to fully enhance learner engagement. Based on this, this study developed a digital game-based AI chatbot system to enhance students' learning experience through digital game-based learning strategies. This study utilized a quasi-experimental design with the experimental group using a digital game-based AI chatbot and the control group using a traditional AI chatbot. A comparison was made between the two groups concerning student learning performance in IT courses, higher-order thinking (including problem-solving, computational thinking, and creativity), learning motivation, and flow experience. In addition, the behavioral patterns of high-achieving and low-achieving students in the experimental group were analyzed. The results showed that the experimental group was significantly better than the control group in academic performance, problem-solving, computational thinking, learning motivation, and flow experience, but there was no significant difference in creativity tendency. Behavioral pattern analysis showed that high-achieving students in the experimental group showed more systematic learning strategies, while low-achieving students relied more on immediate feedback and external help, but both high- and low-achieving groups were able to actively talk to the AI chatbot and actively explore problem-solving strategies in the digital game. Therefore, AI chatbots based on digital games can be effectively used in IT courses to help students construct knowledge and develop higher-order thinking.;;15;14;English;"STRATEGIES; EDUCATION; MODEL; MOBILE; ACHIEVEMENT; SYSTEM; MOTIVATION; FLOW; EXPERIENCE; game-based learning; PERCEPTIONS; AI chatbot; higher-order thinking; information technology course"

With this aim, a group of children (N = 191) from two primary schools were studied for two years beginning from the fourth grade, as they engaged in our block-based programming curriculum in their primary schools. A mixed-methods multiple case study was designed with pre- and posttests, classroom observations and postintervention interviews. The statistical results showed that students' algorithmic thinking and debugging skills significantly increased through our intervention, with girls gaining more on algorithmic thinking. During the students' learning process, we found that they demonstrated behavioral, affective, and cognitive engagement while acquiring these skills in schools.

Algebraic laws of functions in coding, however, are rarely considered. Yet, they are essential. For example, commutativity and associativity are crucial to ensure correctness of a variety of software systems in numerous domains, such as compiler optimization, big data processing, data flow processing, machine learning or distributed algorithms and data structures. Still, most programming languages lack built-in mechanisms to enforce and verify that operations adhere to such properties. In this paper, we propose a verifier specialized on a set of fundamental algebraic laws that ensures that such laws hold in application code. The verifier can conjecture auxiliary properties and can reason about both equalities and inequalities of expressions, which is crucial to prove a given property when other competitors do not succeed. We implement these ideas in the Propel verifier. Our evaluation against five state-of-the-art verifiers on a total of 142 instances of algebraic properties shows that Propel is able to automatically deduce algebraic properties in different domains that rely on such properties for correctness, even in cases where competitors fail to verify the same properties or time out.;;PLDI;8;English;"Algebraic Properties; PROOFS; SPECIFICATIONS; Type Systems; Verification"

In that sense, the convergence of AI's learning ability and IoT connectivity makes it possible to build a more intelligent and automated system. Therefore, AI education in preparation for the era of hyper-convergence and hyper-connectivity should not stop at just experiencing artificial intelligence technology and understanding its principles, but should move toward experiencing a more expanded world. Accordingly, major countries around the world believe that young learners need the ability to naturally access and handle the latest technology, and are actively taking the lead in information education, including AI education, from kindergarten to elementary and middle school. Accordingly, this researcher believed that for elementary school students who fall into the specific operational stage of Piaget's cognitive development theory, AIoT education is necessary as AI convergence education that creates specific outputs in connection with real life. To this end, we developed an AIoT education program (12 topics, 24 sessions in total) using DIYGO, which can implement IoT robots using various input/output sensors and CPU boards. Among these, considering the students' level and interest, the contents of the 12th session on 6 topics were applied to an experimental class of 6th grade elementary school students (24 students), and effectiveness was verified through pre- and post-paired sample t-tests. The measurement tools used to verify the effectiveness of this study are the AI literacy test tool developed by Kim (Effect of PBL-based AI convergence education programs on AI literacy and creative problem-solving skills of elementary school students, 2023) and the digital literacy test tool developed by Lee et al. (2021). The test sheet questions were reorganized focusing on questions on areas related to the learning elements covered in the AIoT education program. In addition, exploratory factor analysis and reliability analysis were conducted to verify the validity and reliability of the measurement tool used in this study, and the results showed a relatively good reliability level of over 0.6. When AIoT education using DIYGO was conducted, the pre- and post-difference test results of students' digital literacy showed statistically significant improvements in all detailed areas of digital literacy. Additionally, the difference verification results for AI literacy showed that it was effective in all detailed areas. Based on the above results, first, at a time when digital and AI literacy is becoming important, AIoT education can be an effective method for cultivating digital and AI literacy in future talent. Second, AIoT education shows the potential as a form of AI convergence education that is integrated with life and solving real-life problems.;107-130;1;30;English;"AI literacy; Elementary school; AIoT; Digital literacy; Education program"

It has become a topic of interest for educators and researchers to explore the effective instructional strategies to improve students' programming knowledge and skills. Cognitive and metacognitive scaffolding have proven to have the potential to facilitate programming performance. However, their comparative effects on programming performance have received scant attention. To fill this research gap, the current study aimed to explore how cognitive and metacognitive scaffolding influence elementary school students' Scratch programming knowledge and skills in an information technology course based on a quasi-experimental design. Three intact classes, including 126 fifth graders, were randomly assigned to a control group and two experimental groups: a cognitive scaffolding and a metacognitive scaffolding group. The findings indicated that the metacognitive scaffolding group showed significantly better scores in programming knowledge and skills than the non-scaffolding group. However, no significant differences were found between the metacognitive and cognitive scaffolding groups, or between the cognitive scaffolding and non-scaffolding groups. This study provides implications for the design and development of scaffolding based on Vygotsky's theory of cognitive and metacognitive mediation, and also contributes to our comprehension of how scaffolding types influence students' programming knowledge and skills.;914-929;4;57;English;"PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; SKILLS; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; ONLINE; GAMES; SCRATCH; Cognitive scaffolding; metacognitive scaffolding; programming knowledge; programming skills"

Reasonable evaluation can help programmers understand their projects better. At the same time, it can also provide a reference for them to browse other projects in the online community. Most of the existing evaluations on Scratch are carried from three perspectives: Computational Thinking (CT) ability, visual presentation aesthetics, and code quality. Among them, the assessment of CT and code quality is mainly carried out from the program script, while the evaluation of visual aesthetics is analyzed from the perspective of image sequences generated by project execution. The single-view evaluation focuses on the performance of a program in a certain aspect and is one-sided. In this paper, we propose a multi-view evaluation framework to integrate various evaluations using different policies. We quantitatively analyze the assessment of different views driven by data. Combined with overall evaluations that represent human opinions, we analyze their differences and connections. Through experiments, we determine the weights of different integration policies, the proposed multi-view evaluation method can generate evaluation results similar to human opinions.;517-528;2;29;English;"machine learning; Codes; Computational Thinking (CT); Scratch; Visualization; integration policy; static analysis; visual aesthetic; Computed tomography; Computer languages; Data analysis; Image sequences"

Thus, the change in programming performance, computational identity, computational thinking perspective, programming empowerment, and programming anxiety according to various variables was examined. The performances of different algorithms were compared in estimating the low and high programming performance of these variables. The research involved 763 students who were between the ages of 12 and 24 and had received programming education. Different scales were used to collect the opinions of students who received programming education. Descriptive analyses, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and machine learning algorithms were used in the analysis of the data set. Analyzes were made in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and Knime software. Decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, random forest, Naive Bayes classifiers, and logistic regression were used in the study. Students' programming performance, computational identity, computational thinking perspective, and programming empowerment mean scores differ in terms of gender and educational level variables. Research variables do not differ statistically in terms of academic success level variables. According to the programming performance level, students' computational identity, computational thinking perspective, and programming empowerment scores differ. No significant difference was found between programming anxiety scores. Decision trees of the algorithm with the highest accuracy result according to low and high programming performance conditions are [(0.966), (0.966)], respectively. The fact that these obtained scores are above 90% can be interpreted as sufficient estimation performance.;;1;32;English;"COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; computational identity; computational thinking perspective; descriptives; EMPOWERMENT; machine learning algorithms; programming anxiety; programming empowerment; Programming performance"

Despite this trend, little work has actually examined how learners engaging in programming process when utilizing these two major programming modalities, especially in the context of secondary education settings.ObjectivesTo further compare programming effects between and within text-based and block-based modalities, this research conducted a quasi-experimental research in China's secondary school.MethodsAn online programming platform, Code4all, was developed to allow learners to program in text-based and block-based modalities. This research collected multimodal data sources, including programming platform data, process data, and performance data. This research further utilized multiple learning analytics approaches (i.e., clustering analysis, click stream analysis, lag-sequential analysis and statistics) to compare learners' programming features, behavioural patterns and knowledge gains under two modalities.Results and ConclusionsThe results indicated that learners in text-based modality tended to write longer lines of code, encountered more syntactical errors, and took longer to attempt debugging. In contrast, learners in block-based modality spent more time operating blocks and attempt debugging, achieving better programming knowledge performances compared to their counterparts. Further analysis of five clusters from the two modalities revealed discrepancies in programming behavioural patterns.ImplicationsThree major pedagogical implications were proposed based on empirical research results. Furthermore, this research contributed to the learning analytics literature by integrating process-oriented and summative analysis to reveal learners' programming learning quality.

The paper describes the development of the new transdisciplinary field of computational archival science (CAS) and the integration of computational thinking (CT) concepts into archival science. Method. The authors show how CAS can be introduced into graduate archival training through two case studies at the University of Maryland and the University of British Columbia and discuss building and sustaining CAS educator networks. Analysis. The paper argues that, given the increasing use of AI in archival work and research, the acquisition of computational skills and competencies is urgent for those entering the profession, but sees several barriers, including the willingness of archival educators to engage in this space, and the shortage of CAS educators. There is also a perceived conflict among some in the archival profession between CAS and recent archival scholarship emphasizing postcolonialism themes. Results. Results show this is a false dichotomy, as demonstrated by the many CAS papers focusing on ethical and social justice aspects of computing and archival work. Conclusion. The teaching of CAS is a necessity for archivists to stay relevant and responsive to the changing landscape. We offer CAS graduate curriculum learning guidelines, ensuring that archives remain accessible, trustworthy, and reflective of our evolving society.;301-318;;30;English;

As the global energy sector transforms to reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, innovations in renewable technologies like solar thermal are pivotal for promoting energy security and economic stability, supported by an educational foundation that fosters awareness and technical skills for sustainable development. Exposure to successful renewable energy systems, such as solar -powered refrigeration, offers an informal educational experience that enhances understanding and supports global educational goals, initiating with the innovative design and optimization of these systems using artificial intelligence (neural networks). Based on this formulation, the current article developed two sustainable energy systems by comparing the refrigeration cycles with two different operating fluids and various arrangements, and multi -objective optimization with an evolutionary genetic algorithm is performed for the proposed systems. The studied systems are refrigeration cycles using an ejector and without an ejector with two working fluids of lithium bromide and lithium chloride. The present work's main aim is to examine the working fluid and refrigeration system arrangements. Energy and economic modeling were performed for the proposed systems, and then parametric analysis and two -objective optimization were extracted. Parameters such as generator temperature, condenser temperature, absorber temperature, and evaporator temperature, which significantly impact the proposed system's performance, have been selected as decision parameters, and parametric analysis has been extracted for them. In addition to the mentioned parameters, diffusion mixing efficiency, nozzle efficiency, and heat exchanger have also been studied in the ejector asset system. To find the best values of decision variables, multi -objective optimization for both arrangements is conducted, and results are presented. The results have indicated that the refrigeration system using lithium chloride working fluid without an ejector achieves a coefficient of performance of 0.766 and a cost of 0.922 $/h at the optimal point, while the system with an ejector yields a higher coefficient of performance (1.047) and a slightly lower cost rate (0.991 $/h).

Employing a learning analytics approach, this study compares the effects of pair and solo programming on K-12 students' CT skills, attitudes, and in-game behaviors. Two sixth-grade classes assigned to solo (n = 22) or pair programming (n = 21) groups participated in a six-week intervention using an online game-based learning environment. Both groups showed improvements in CT skills and attitudes, but the solo programming group achieved greater CT skill gains. In-game logs revealed solo programmers focused more on game creation and less on game remixing. The solo programmers also designed a more complex gameworld and used more coding blocks; however, the complexity of the programming codes remained similar between groups. These findings highlight the distinct benefits of each approach: solo programming fosters self-directed trial-and-error experimentation, while pair programming promotes collaboration and openness to diverse perspectives through shared exploration of others' creations.";;;;English;"PERFORMANCE; Computational thinking; EDUCATION; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; Game-based learning; Collaborative learning; Computer science education; Learning analytics; CODE; ATTITUDES; COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY; Pair programming; Solo programming"

However, access to programming education remains unequal, particularly in non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) contexts. This study presents a dataset resulting from an educational intervention designed to foster programming competencies and computational thinking skills among primary school students aged 8 to 12 years in Milagro, Ecuador. The intervention integrated Scratch, a block-based programming environment that simplifies coding by eliminating syntactic barriers, and the CARAMBA recommendation system, which provided personalized learning paths based on students' progression and preferences. A structured educational process was implemented, including an initial diagnostic test to assess logical reasoning, guided activities in Scratch to build foundational skills, a phase of personalized practice with CARAMBA, and a final computational thinking evaluation using a validated assessment instrument. The resulting dataset encompasses diverse information: demographic data, logical reasoning test scores, computational thinking test results pre- and post-intervention, activity logs from Scratch, recommendation histories from CARAMBA, and qualitative feedback from university student tutors who supported the intervention. The dataset is anonymized, ethically collected, and made available under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage reuse. This resource is particularly valuable for researchers and practitioners interested in computational thinking development, educational data mining, personalized learning systems, and digital equity initiatives. It supports comparative studies between WEIRD and non-WEIRD populations, validation of adaptive learning models, and the design of inclusive programming curricula. Furthermore, the dataset enables the application of machine learning techniques to predict educational outcomes and optimize personalized educational strategies. By offering this dataset openly, the study contributes to filling critical gaps in educational research, promoting inclusive access to programming education, and fostering a more comprehensive understanding of how computational competencies can be developed across diverse socioeconomic and cultural contexts.Dataset: The full dataset generated and analyzed during the study, along with the paper draft, are available at the (1) Institutional Repository for the CARAMBA system: https://github.com/nvalerod/carambaNew (accessed on 20 May 2025) and (2) GitHub Repository: https://github.com/cvidalmsu/UNEMI_1 (accessed on 10 May 2025).

This research incorporates teaching methods like problem-based learning, experiential learning, task-based learning, and content-language integrated learning, with English as the medium of instruction. These tools were strategically used to enhance language skills, foster computational thinking, and promote critical problem-solving. A control group comprising 120 students who did not receive AI support was included in the study for comparative analysis. The control group's role was essential in evaluating the impact of AI tools on learning outcomes by providing a baseline for comparison. The results indicated that the pilot group, utilising AI tools, demonstrated superior performance compared to the control group in listening comprehension (98.79% vs. 90.22%) and conceptual understanding (95.82% vs. 84.23%). These findings underscore the significance of these skills in enhancing communication and problem-solving abilities within the field of engineering. The assessment of the pilot course's forum revealed a progression from initially error-prone and brief responses to refined, evidence-based reflections in participants. This evolution in responses significantly contributed to the high success rate of 87% in conducting complex contextual analyses by pilot course participants. Subsequent to these results, a project for educational innovation aims to implement the AI-PBL-CLIL model at Universidad Polit & eacute;cnica de Madrid from 2025 to 2026. Future research should look into adaptive AI systems for personalised learning and study the long-term effects of AI integration in higher education. Furthermore, collaborating with industry partners can significantly enhance the practical application of AI-based methods in engineering education. These strategies facilitate benchmarking against international standards, provide structured support for skill development, and ensure the sustained retention of professional competencies, ultimately elevating the international recognition of Spain's engineering education.";;10;18;English;"educational innovation; digital competencies; artificial intelligence in education; AI-enhanced learning; content and language integrated learning; engineering education; higher-order thinking skills; problem-based learning; STEM pedagogy; telecommunications engineering"

Educational robotics is increasingly recognized for its potential to improve student engagement, foster computational thinking, and support broader educational reforms aligned with global development objectives. Despite this growth, a comprehensive, large-scale mapping of how research in this area has developed, particularly in relation to global frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), remains limited. This study addresses that gap by conducting a bibliometric analysis of 1120 peer-reviewed publications on robotics in education indexed in the SSCI Web of Science from 2015 to 2024. The research utilizes a triangulated methodological approach combining Bibliometric.com, Biblioshiny, and VOSViewer to explore publication trends, authorship patterns, institutional and geographic distribution, keyword co-occurrence, and thematic evolution over time. The results reveal a sharp increase in publication volume after 2018, with significant contributions from the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. Key thematic trends include computational thinking, human-robot interaction, and early childhood learning. The study also identifies how this body of research aligns with specific SDGs, particularly SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). These findings provide a clearer understanding of the intellectual landscape and global impact of educational robotics research. By identifying dominant contributors, emerging topics, and structural gaps, this study informs future academic inquiry, policymaking, and investment strategies in technology-enhanced education with a sustainability focus.;;1;12;English;"SCIENCE; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; CHILDREN; SCHOOL; GENDER; AGE; STUDENTS COMPUTATIONAL THINKING"

An experimental study was conducted with 72 students in a middle school for 16 weeks. A performance assessment given at the end of the course was used as a reflection tool in one group (RPA), while given during the learning process as a guidance tool in another group (GPA). Results indicated that GPA showed a significantly better effect than RPA on students' learning attitude and computational thinking, although the improvement in learning performance and 4C key competencies was not evident. Within the 4C sub-dimensions, GPA outperformed RPA in promoting students' creativity and collaboration. However, the RPA group performed significantly better in improving critical thinking. The results confirmed that both GPA and RPA played an important role in robotics education. GPA provides a structured learning experience with clear goals and expectations, allowing students to effectively adjust their learning strategies through immediate feedback and a greater sense of control over their learning process with a positive attitude. In contrast, RPA encourages students to critically reflect on their learning journey from a holistic perspective, which increases student autonomy and deep learning during the process, while requiring a level of self-awareness and introspection that may be challenging for some students. The advantages and disadvantages of both approaches were discussed. The findings highlight the importance of adopting an appropriate approach to performance assessment and avoiding over-guidance in robotics education.;208-224;4;28;English;"Computational thinking; STUDENTS; SKILLS; IMPACT; 4C key competencies; LEARNING ACHIEVEMENT; PERCEPTION; Performance assessment; Robotics course"

The analysis identifies five overarching categories of human-GenAI interaction: Tutoring, Cocreating, Processing, Coaching, and Simulating, primarily leveraged to support individual learners in developing problem-solving, critical thinking, and computational thinking skills. While the findings highlight GenAI's potential to support constructivist active learning, its application remains largely individual in scope. Moreover, challenges related to algorithmic bias, information reliability, privacy, and limited domain specificity constrain the orchestration of synergistic human-GenAI interaction, placing significant pedagogical demands on both educators and learners when interacting with GenAI-powered applications. Future research should explore how human-GenAI interactions can be orchestrated to support more active, collaborative, and context-sensitive learning environments. This includes supporting students in developing the competencies necessary to engage, individually and collaboratively, with GenAI tools reflectively, purposefully, and meaningfully in ways that enhance active learning.;;;239;English;"Generative artificial intelligence; Problem-solving; CHATGPT; Collaborative learning; STEM education; Active learning; Higher-order thinking skills; Literature review"

In the future, human collaboration with AI is inevitable. Therefore, exploring the attitudes of future workers-represented by current K-12 children-towards AI has become crucial. Robots stand as typical representatives of AI. Robot programming education is an important component of STEM education. This study aims to explore the impact of early robot programming education on the attitudes of rural children in developing countries towards robots. We explored changes in attitudes towards robots among rural primary students before and after robot education, as well as gender differences in these changes. A seven-week robot programming course was implemented for 175 sixth-grade students (comprising 96 boys and 79 girls) in a rural primary school in the south-western part of China. Two rounds of data collection, conducted as pre-tests and post-tests, were administered before and after the courses. The results indicate that: (1) Rural children maintain a positive and favourable attitude towards robots; (2) Robot programming education increased certain negative attitudes of rural children towards robots, especially among boys; (3) Robotics education significantly increased girls' acceptance of robots, perceiving them as human-subordinate companions. Boys were less likely to hold such beliefs; (4) Robotics education also amplified girls' concerns about potential human replacement by robots. However, these concerns remained within an optimistic range; (5) Robotics education to some extent increased the self-efficacy of rural children in manipulating robots, especially among boys, but this improvement did not reach a significant level overall. This study contributes to understanding the attitudes of rural children in developing countries towards robots (AI). It is also beneficial for STEM educators to understand the importance of early robot education for these rural children.";7045-7076;6;30;English;"PERFORMANCE; SCIENCE; LITERACY; SKILLS; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; AGE; Attitude of robots; Gender differences; PLS; Robot programming education; Rural primary school students"

These courses, however, should not replicate the technical focus typically found in introductory computer science (CS) courses like CS1 and CS2. In this paper, we use an adjustable, interdisciplinary socio-technical AI literacy framework to design and present an introductory AI literacy course. We present a refined version of this framework informed by the teaching of a 1-credit general education AI literacy course (primarily for freshmen and first-year students from various majors), a 3-credit course for CS majors at all levels, and a summer camp for high school students. Drawing from these teaching experiences and the evolving research landscape, we propose an introductory AI literacy course design framework structured around four cross-cutting pillars. These pillars encompass (1) understanding the scope and technical dimensions of AI technologies, (2) learning how to interact with (generative) AI technologies, (3) applying principles of critical, ethical, and responsible AI usage, and (4) analyzing implications of AI on society. We posit that achieving AI literacy is essential for all students, those pursuing AI-related careers, and those following other educational or professional paths. This introductory course, positioned at the beginning of a program, creates a foundation for ongoing and advanced AI education. The course design approach is presented as a series of modules and subtopics under each pillar. We emphasize the importance of thoughtful instructional design, including pedagogy, expected learning outcomes, and assessment strategies. This approach not only integrates social and technical learning but also democratizes AI education across diverse student populations and equips all learners with the socio-technical, multidisciplinary perspectives necessary to navigate and shape the ethical future of AI.;;2;46;English;CURRICULUM

However, AI faces a talent shortage, and the widening gender gap exacerbates this issue. Given the crucial role of secondary schools in nurturing students' interest in AI and shaping their career paths, this study sought to investigate the link between secondary school students' attitude toward AI learning, their AI literacy, and their interest in AI careers while examining possible gender differences. We used the AI Learning Attitude Survey, AI Literacy Survey, and AI Career Interest Survey to collect data from 622 secondary school students who were selected with a stratified sampling method. The survey data were then analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings revealed that: (1) female students demonstrate lower levels of AI learning attitude, AI literacy, and AI career interest compared to their male counterparts, whereas no gender differences were found in the model of learning attitude-AI literacy-career interest; (2) positive AI learning attitude and AI literacy predict higher AI career interest, with learning attitude positively influencing AI literacy; (3) AI literacy significantly mediates the relationship between AI learning attitude and AI career interest. The findings highlight the necessity for K-12 schools to introduce both formal and informal AI education initiatives at an early stage. By fostering inclusive and supportive environments, schools can inspire all students, especially girls, to boost their AI literacy and consider career opportunities in this field. Such efforts will play a vital role in advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion within the AI sector.";;;;English;"AI education; AI literacy; SCIENCE; GENDER; Gender differences; AI career interest; AI learning attitude"

This study aimed to develop and validate the AI Literacy in L2 Writing Scale (AIL-L2WS), designed for university-level English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners in China. Drawing on established AI literacy frameworks, the scale was adapted to the cognitive, ethical, and psychological demands of L2 writing. It encompasses four subdimensions: understanding AI in L2 writing, applying AI in L2 writing, ethics and risk awareness, and self-efficacy and attitudes toward AI-assisted writing. In the pilot phase, item analysis and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with 385 participants produced a 26-item version with high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.960). This revised scale was then administered to 480 participants, yielding 420 valid responses after data screening. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) further refined the instrument to 22 items, demonstrating strong reliability and construct validity. By integrating cognitive, ethical, and affective dimensions, the AIL-L2WS offers a comprehensive tool for examining AI literacy in L2 writing and provides an empirically grounded basis for future research on learner competencies in AI-mediated academic writing contexts.;;;;English;"AI literacy; SELF-EFFICACY; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; USER ACCEPTANCE; Chinese higher education; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; L2 writing; Scale development and validation"

Our research aims to propose the integration of STEM into National Curricula via active learning.PurposeThis paper provides insights gathered from an educational intervention case study that examines the development, training of educators, and incorporation of active learning educational scenarios. These scenarios aim to introduce students to programming through low-code software development. Through an interdisciplinary collaboration between technology and science educators, students engaged in developing mobile applications focused on public health topics like nutrition and hygiene.SampleThe scenarios were implemented in six schools, involving active participation from thirty-two classes - sixteen study classes and sixteen control classes. Each scenario unfolded over approximately 5 to 8 sessions. The first scenario, designed for 7th-grade students, engaged 95 participants, the second for 8th-grade involved 105 students, and the third had 112 participants.Design and methodsThe formulation and execution of the course design were guided by the ADDIE instructional design model framework, encompassing stages such as Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation.ResultsPositive feedback from educators regarding the preparation and execution of educational scenarios provides evidence that this approach cultivates conducive learning environments and facilitates holistic student development. Moreover, our findings suggest that, from the educators' perspective, students enhance their scientific skills and demonstrate increased interest in science. Additionally, survey results among educators indicate a favorable perception of students' attitudes toward the implemented course design.ConclusionOur primary contribution lies in proposing an interdisciplinary approach to incorporate integrated STEM educational scenarios into national curricula, in line with UNESCO's recent recommendation for a comprehensive curriculum reform prioritizing the transition from basic digital literacy to advanced computational thinking skills.;;;;English;"Improving classroom teaching; IMPACT; INSTRUCTION; teaching/learning strategies; STEM; 21st century abilities; ADOLESCENTS; BEHAVIOR; FLIPPED CLASSROOM; HYGIENE; interdisciplinary projects; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; SANITATION"

To succeed as the workers, creators, and innovators of the future, we argue students should encounter core concepts of AI as early as elementary school. However, building a curriculum that introduces AI content to K-12 students presents significant challenges, such as connecting to prior knowledge, developing curricula that are meaningful for students, and creating content that teachers feel confident to teach. To lay the groundwork for elementary AI education, we investigated the everyday experiences and ideas of students in grades 4 and 5 (ages 9 to 11) about AI to inform possible entry points for learning. This yielded themes around student conceptions, examples, and ethics of AI. For each theme, we juxtapose the student ideas with the teachers' reflections on those ideas as frames of reference to consider in co-designing curricular approaches.;267-289;2;33;English;"CURRICULUM; KNOWLEDGE; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; SCIENCE-EDUCATION; AI Ethics; Elementary Education; K-12 AI education; Teacher co-design; VISION"

This program provides underrepresented youth, especially girls, with digital forensic knowledge, skills and career pathways, challenging them to explore complex social issues related to technology and to become cyber sleuths using real-world digital forensic methods and tools to solve investigative scenarios. Students also learn about related careers while improving their cyber street smarts. The CSSL incorporates additional ""outside of the computer"" activities to strengthen students' engagement such as structured in-classroom discussions, mock trials, and in-person interactions with practitioner role models. The CSSL was piloted in various forms to assess the suitability for in-school and out-of-school settings, and the students predominantly represented racial minorities. Research in this project relied on a mixed methods approach for data collection and analysis,including qualitative and quantitative methods, reinforced using learning analytics generated from the students clicking through the interface and interacting with the system. Analysis of gathered data indicate that the virtual learning environment developed in this project is highly effective for teaching digital forensic knowledge, skills, and abilities that are directly applicable in the workplace. Furthermore, the strategies for gender inclusive STEM instruction implemented in CSSL are effective for engaging girls without being harmful to boys ' engagement. Learning STEM through digital forensic science taps into girls' motivations to address real-world problems that have direct relevance to their lives, and to protect and serve their community. After participating in the educational program, girls expressed a significantly greater increase in interest, relative to boys, in learning more about careers related to digital forensics and cybersecurity.";;1;10;English;"STEM education; Cybersecurity; Digital forensic science; Gender inclusive instruction; Investigate and Decide Learning Environment; Problem based learning; Smart learning environment; Skill Development; STEM Education; Learner Engagement; Gender Issues; Student Motivation; Career Awareness; Career Pathways; Disproportionate Representation; Females; Inclusion; Program Design; Program Implementation; Youth"

Moreover, the empirical study actually implemented the curriculum in the formal learning of a secondary school for a period of six weeks. The study evaluated the learning performance of students who were taught with the cycle of experiential learning in one class, while also evaluating the learning performance of students who were taught with the conventional instruction, which was called the cycle of doing projects. Two factors, learning approach and gender, were taken into account. The results showed that females' learning effectiveness was significantly better than that of males regardless of whether they used experiential learning or the conventional projects approach. Most of the males tended to be distracted from the conversational AI curriculum because they misbehaved during the conversational AI process. In particular, in their performance using the Voice User Interface with the conventional learning approach, the females outperformed the males significantly. The results of two-way ANCOVA revealed a significant interaction between gender and learning approach on computational thinking concepts. Females with the conventional learning approach of doing projects had the best computational thinking concepts in comparison with the other groups.;82-103;1;23;English;"K-12; Artificial Intelligence; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; LANGUAGES; Programming; block-based programming; experiential learning; conversational AI application; gender studies; Computation; Thinking Skills; Secondary School Students; Gender Differences; Experiential Learning; Instructional Effectiveness; Curriculum Design; Learning Processes; Computer Mediated Communication"

XFVLRTHT;journalArticle;2020;Salas-Pilco, SZ;The impact of AI and robotics on physical, social-emotional and intellectual learning outcomes: An integrated analytical framework;BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY;0007-1013;10.1111/bjet.12984;This qualitative study examines the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics in learning designs from the perspective of learning sciences. The literature on the topic indicates that there is not enough research on including diverse learning outcomes in the designs for learning. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to understand how AI and robots impact physical, social-emotional and intellectual learning outcomes through the implementation of learning designs that are guided by selected design principles. In this study, the design-based research (DBR) methodology was employed for investigating learning in naturalistic contexts. The intervention was implemented in a primary school in which learners used educational robots. The main findings reveal that the development of an integrated analytical framework, which considers a broader spectrum of human potential, allows for analyzing students' learning outcomes in a more integral, inclusive and balanced way. This, in turn, promotes students' learning by using AI and robots. Another finding reveals that the impact of using AI and robotics on learning designs is reflected in learners' personal trajectories having different pathways and paces. Finally, the lessons learned and the challenges to be overcome are summarized, and recommendations are made for future research for the enhancement of learning experiences that use AI and robotics.;1808-1825;5;51;English;"DESIGN; STUDENTS; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; PRINCIPLES"

Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners' performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners' final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners' actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners' performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners' action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R-2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial in the deep learning model.;20399-20417;;11;English;"computational thinking; Education; Machine learning; deep learning; Computational modeling; Games; Performance evaluation; educational games; Adaptation models; Deep learning; Early performance prediction; learner model; Learning systems; Predictive models; STUDENT PERFORMANCE"
D4GGRT8E;journalArticle;2024;Hooshyar, D;Temporal learner modelling through integration of neural and symbolic architectures;EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES;1360-2357;10.1007/s10639-023-12334-y;Neural and symbolic architectures are key techniques in AI for learner modelling, enhancing adaptive educational services. Symbolic models offer explanation and reasoning for decisions but require significant human effort. On the other hand, neural architectures demand less human input and yield better predictions, yet lack interpretability. Given the high-risk nature of education and that incorrectly tailored support can negatively affect learning outcomes, the integration of neural and symbolic architectures becomes crucial. This research proposes a novel neural-symbolic AI approach for temporal learner modelling, called TemporaLM, that leverages unsupervised deep neural networks (i.e., autoencoders enriched with symbolic educational knowledge) and dynamic Bayesian networks for learners' knowledge tracing over time. The approach employs a dynamic Bayesian network for temporal knowledge tracking in learners' computational thinking and employs a knowledge-based autoencoder to enhance predictive performance through synthetic data augmentation. Our findings from both cross-validation and practical application demonstrate that the TemporaLM approach, trained on the neural-symbolic AI augmented dataset, achieves better generalizability, yielding an accuracy of 85% and an F1 score of 87%. This surpasses the dynamic Bayesian network trained solely on original and autoencoder-augmented data. Notably, by leveraging the transformed dataset for model training, improvements of up to 8% in F1 score and 5% in accuracy were achieved compared to the original dataset, observed in both cross-validation and application stages. The augmented prediction capabilities, coupled with interpretable knowledge tracing, cultivate trust among educators and learners in data-driven decisions. These findings underline the potential of neural-symbolic family of AI to improve limitation of existing (symbolic) AI methods in education, advancing AI's potential in education and enabling trustworthy and interpretable applications.;1119-1146;1;29;English;"Artificial Intelligence; KNOWLEDGE; Learner modelling; Personalized learning; AI for education; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; Neural-symbolic; Trustworthy AI; Technology Uses in Education; Learner Engagement; Prediction; Achievement; Computer Oriented Programs; Modeling (Psychology); Students; Teachers"

The article beings with positioning the OER within wider pedagogical debates in the digital humanities. The OER is built from our research encounters and committed to computational thinking rather than technicalities. Furthermore, we argue that students best learn with the `whole game' methodology. Learners need to be exposed to meaningful activities as soon and as far as possible. The article presents two examples that implement our approach. The first introduces Python as a data analysis language to students of the humanities. It is different because it concentrates on the principles of the computational thinking behind data analysis rather than programming details. The second example takes the students into the world of machine learning and the whole game of social and cultural research with it.

In this study, we introduced the Computer Science unplugged (CS-unplugged) technique in Pakistan. We use paper-based activities to equip students with basic Computer Science skills without introducing any programming language. This study contributes twofold: First, we report the impact of CS-Unplugged training on more than 350 elementary students. The empirical study reveals that the students perform better in solving problems after unplugged training. Improved results in the post-training activity support this impact. Second, we applied machine learning to predict students' performance. We employed different supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the students' performance. Our results indicate that the Logistic regression-based model can predict the positive response of the student with a 0.91 receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve). This pilot study results encourage introducing unplugged techniques at elementary schools in third-world countries. The goal is to have minimal changes in infrastructure and focus on better student learning. In the future, we plan to introduce more unplugged problem-solving techniques to elementary students by providing little training to the science or math teacher.;;9;13;English;"EDUCATION; machine learning; CURRICULUM; computer science education; computer science unplugged; data analytical; Pakistan education; supervised learning algorithms"

In this article, we present our research on the automatic identification of the need for assistance among primary school children performing Scratch exercises. For data collection, user experiences have been designed to take into account ethical aspects, including gender bias. Finally, a first-in-class distance calculation method for block-based programming languages has been used in a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, with the aim of identifying when a primary school student needs help while he/she carries out Scratch exercises. This model has been trained twice: the first time taking into account the gender of the students, and the second time excluding it. The accuracy of the model that includes gender is 99.2%, while that of the model that excludes gender is 91.1%. We conclude that taking into account gender in training this model can lead to overfitting, due to the under-representation of girls among the students participating in the experiences, making the model less able to identify when a student needs help. We also conclude that avoiding gender bias is a major challenge in research on educational systems for learning computational thinking skills, and that it necessarily involves effective and motivating gender-sensitive instructional design.;;23;13;English;"block-based programming language; distance calculation; ethics in AI; LSTM model; teaching with Scratch"

It is a learning environment where children explore mathematical ideas and create projects of their own design. Logo, the first programming language explicitly designed for children, was invented by Seymour Papert, Wallace Feurzeig, Daniel Bobrow, and Cynthia Solomon in 1966 at Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN). Logo's design drew upon two theoretical frameworks: Jean Piaget's constructivism and Marvin Minsky's artificial intelligence research at MIT. One of Logo's foundational ideas was that children should have a powerful programming environment. Early Lisp served as a model with its symbolic computation, recursive functions, operations on linked lists, and dynamic scoping of variables. Logo became a symbol for change in elementary mathematics education and in the nature of school itself. The search for harnessing the computer's potential to provide new ways of teaching and learning became a central focus and guiding principle in Logo language development. It encompassed a widening scope that included natural language, music, graphics, animation, story telling, turtle geometry, robots, and other physical devices.;;;4;English;"Constructionism; Computing education programsDComputer science education; Computing educations- Computational thinking; Computing literacy; Constructivism; Data types and structures; Education-Interactive learning environments; Functional languages; functions and subroutines; History of computingsHistory of programming languages; Imperative languages; Informal education; Interactive computation.; K-12 education (ages 5-18); Lambda calculus; Language featuressControl structures; Lisp; Logo; Procedures; Recursion; Recursive functions; Software notations and tools- General programming languages; Theory of computations-Models of computation-computabilitys-; turtle geometry"

More specifically, we are interested in understanding the interplay between moments of collaboration and cooperation, which is an understudied area of research. We collected a multimodal dataset during a collaborative learning activity typical of makerspaces: learning how to program a robot. Pairs of participants were introduced to computational thinking concepts using a block-based environment. Mobile eye-trackers, physiological wristbands, and motion sensors captured their behavior and social interactions. In this paper, we analyze the eye-tracking data to capture participants' tendency to synchronize their visual attention. This paper provides three contributions: (1) we use an emerging methodology (mobile dual eye-tracking) to capture joint visual attention in a co-located setting and replicate findings that show how levels of joint visual attention are positively correlated with collaboration quality; (2) we qualitatively analyzed the co-occurrence of verbal activity and joint visual attention in low and high performing groups to better understand moments of collaboration and cooperation; (3) inspired by the qualitative observations and theories of collaborative learning, we designed a new quantitative measure that captures cycles of collaborative and cooperative work. Compared to simple measures of joint visual attention, we found it to increase correlation coefficients with learning and collaboration scores. We discuss those results and describe how advances in analyzing sensor data can contribute to theories of collaboration. We conclude with implications for capturing students' interactions in co-located spaces using Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA).";26-55;1;42;English;"Programming; Learning Analytics; CONSTRUCTIVIST; JOINT VISUAL-ATTENTION; MOVEMENTS; PERSPECTIVES; Correlation; Cooperative Learning; Thinking Skills; Computer Science Education; Adults; Learning Activities; Robotics; Task Analysis; Multimedia Materials; Eye Movements; Attention Control; Computer Assisted Instruction; Learning Theories; Measurement Equipment; Physiology; Socialization; Verbal Communication"

Indeed, syntax errors-which form one of two broad categories of errors in programming, the other one being logic errors-are omitted while block programming. However, this does not mean that errors are omitted at large in such environments. In this exploratory case study of a learning environment for early programming (Kodetu), we explored errors in block programming of middle school students (N = 123), using log files drawn from a block-based online. Analyzing 1033 failed executions, we found that errors may be driven by either learners' knowledge and behavior, or by the learning environment design. The rate of error types was not associated with the learners' and contextual variables examined, with the exception of task complexity (as defined by SOLO taxonomy). Our findings highlight the importance of learning from errors and of learning environment design.;178-207;1;61;English;"computational thinking; learning analytics; LANGUAGES; THINKING; Programming; SCRATCH; ANALYTICS; Learning Analytics; block programming; error classification; log files; NOVICE; student errors; TEXT; Computation; Foreign Countries; Thinking Skills; Computer Science Education; Elementary School Students; Educational Environment; Spain; Error Patterns; Classification"

Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. In terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards.;123588-123602;;9;English;"VALIDITY; Computational thinking; Education; Problem-solving; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; Programming profession; Tools; skills; Games; Data mining; intrinsic motivation; SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY; persistence; early ages; game learning analytics; interests; learn to program; Licenses; rewards; video games"

Thus, our research aim is to explore the correlation between algorithmic thinking (AT), as a fundamental CT competency, and educational achievements in the Environmental Study course during the early primary school years. Towards this end, we implemented a quantitative research study, employing an innovative assessment framework we propose. The adoption of cluster sampling eventuated in a sample of 435 students. The exploitation of ordinal logistic regression analysis and machine learning method validated the correlation of the two fields and pointed out that AT levels constitute a predictive factor for performance in the Environmental Study course and vice versa. These results support the novel idea of concurrently cultivating environmental consciousness and CT and build a robust base for future studies that will focus on providing an ecological reflection on CT activities.;;17;14;English;"computational thinking; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; gamification; STEM; EARLY-CHILDHOOD EDUCATION; educational apps; educational methodologies; PRESCHOOL EDUCATION; teaching programming"

The DSfAC intends to educate a STEM-literate future citizenry with refined computational thinking (CT), and coding and robotics skills. As with all learning, foundations are ideally laid when children are young and when they form habits of thinking that can ultimately serve as their first building blocks for successful learning. Current theoretical frameworks describe how teachers can include CT, coding and other STEM related constructs in their teaching. In the curriculum plan, a conceptual framework that underpins the design of teaching materials to support STEM literacy teaching, has, however, not yet been forwarded. Aim: Presenting a conceptual framework that has served as the design heuristic for a dialogue reading programme (DRP) for young children. The programme consists of three picture books, created to develop young children's digital skills and related vocabulary as outlined in the DSfAC through story texts and pictures. Method: I implemented an iterative participatory approach to develop the conceptual framework. Conclusion: The development of teaching materials, like a DRP, should have its genesis in a confluence of three interdisciplinary components to develop a conceptual framework: (1) scientific research and theories; (2) an iterative participatory approach which involves teachers, parents, children, and other role players in the development process; and (3) systematic utilisation of existing examples of relevant teaching materials.";;1;11;English;"artificial intelligence; computational thinking; KNOWLEDGE; coding; STEM education; MATH; conceptual framework; dialogue reading; digital skills; early grades; LANGUAGE"

Within the conceptual framework of computational logistics, an attention mechanism oriented hybrid convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network deep learning architecture (AMO-HCR-DLA) is proposed technically to predict the container terminal liner handling conditions that mainly include liner handling time (LHT) and total working time of quay crane farm (TWT-QCF) for a calling liner. Consequently, the container terminal oriented logistics generalized computation (CTO-LGC) automation and intelligence are established tentatively by AMO-HCR-DLA. A typical regional container terminal hub of China is selected to design, implement, execute, and evaluate the AMO-HCR-DLA with the actual production data. In the case of severe vibration of LHT and TWT-QCF, while forecasting the handling conditions of 210 ships based on the CTO-LGC running log of four years, the forecasting error of LHT within one hour is more than 97% and that of TWT-QCF within six hours accounts for 89.405%. When predicting the operating conditions of 300 liners by the log of five years, the forecasting deviation of LHT within one hour is more than striking 99% and that of TWT-QCF within six hours reaches up to 94.010% as well. All are far superior to the predicting outcomes by the classical algorithms of machine learning and deep learning. Hence, the AMO-HCR-DLA shows excellent performance for the prediction of CTHS with the low and stable computational consuming. It also demonstrates the feasibility, credibility, and realizability of the computing architecture and design paradigm of AMO-HCR-DLA preliminarily.;;;2021;English;"MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; IMAGE; LOGISTICS"

The research presented herein is a first attempt to define a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges using log data obtained from Kodetu, which is a block-based maze game. Specifically, we conducted three studies with 9- to 16-year-old students who were asked to solve sequences of maze-based programming challenges. Using log data from these studies, we investigated the maze characteristics and the coding limitations that affect performance in the challenges and calculated the performance obtained by the participants using a fuzzy rule-based system. The results showed that the turns in a maze, the number of total steps of a maze, and the blocks provided affect student performance. Using regression analysis, we defined a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges that considers the weights of these factors and provides a first step towards the design of adaptive learning paths for computational thinking-related educational games.;64211-64223;;9;English;"Computational thinking; Programming profession; Tools; LEVEL; Games; educational games; Visualization; ABSOLUTE ERROR MAE; Atmospheric measurements; block-based maze game; difficulty; Extraterrestrial measurements; Particle measurements; RMSE"

So far, a multitude of such techniques have been proposed, but unfortunately due to their sparse availability, and the dependency on high-end computational literacy, their wider adaptation faces challenges, at least in the context of G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs)-associated chemosensory research. Here, we report Machine-OIF-Action (MOA), a user-friendly, open-source computational framework, that utilizes user-supplied SMILES (simplified molecular input line entry system) of the chemicals, along with their activation status, to synthesize classification models. MOA integrates a number of popular chemical databases collectively harboring approximately 103 million chemical moieties. MOA also facilitates customized screening of user-supplied chemical datasets. A key feature of MOA is its ability to embed molecules based on the similarity of their local neighborhood, by utilizing a state-of-the-art model interpretability framework LIME. We demonstrate the utility of MOA in identifying previously unreported agonists for human and mouse olfactory receptors OR1A1 and MOR174-9 by leveraging the chemical features of their known agonists and non-agonists.

Methods A quasi-experimental design was conducted over two academic years (2023-2024) with 234 undergraduate students in a Java web application development course. Intact class sections were randomly assigned to AI-assisted pair programming (using GPT-3.5 Turbo in 2023 and Claude 3 Opus in 2024), human-human pair programming, or individual programming conditions. Data on intrinsic motivation, programming anxiety, collaborative perceptions, and programming performance were collected at three time points using validated instruments. Results Compared to individual programming, AI-assisted pair programming significantly increased intrinsic motivation (p < .001, d = 0.35) and reduced programming anxiety (p < .001), producing outcomes comparable to human-human pair programming. AI-assisted groups also outperformed both individual and human-human groups in programming tasks (p < .001). However, human-human pair programming fostered the highest perceptions of collaboration and social presence, surpassing both AI-assisted and individual conditions (p < .001). Mediation analysis revealed that perceived usefulness of the AI assistant significantly mediated the relationship between the programming approach and student outcomes, highlighting the importance of positive perceptions in leveraging AI tools for educational benefits. No significant differences emerged between the two AI models employed, indicating that both GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 3 Opus provided similar benefits. Conclusion While AI-assisted pair programming enhances motivation, reduces anxiety, and improves performance, it does not fully match the collaborative depth and social presence achieved through human-human pairing. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of AI and human interaction: AI support can bolster learning outcomes, yet human partners offer richer social engagement. As AI capabilities advance, educators should integrate such tools thoughtfully, ensuring that technology complements rather than replaces the interpersonal dynamics and skill development central to effective programming education.;;1;12;English;"INFORMATION; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL; Collaborative learning; Programming performance; AI-assisted pair programming; EXTENSION; Intrinsic motivation; Programming anxiety"

The carbon precursor was soaked with phosphoric acid, followed by pyrolysis to convert the precursor into activated biochar. The surface morphology of the adsorbent (before and after dye adsorption) was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS), BET method, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and, lastly, pH(pzc) was also determined. Batch studies were carried out in the following intervals of pH = 4-10, temperature = 300.15-330.15 K, the dose of adsorbent = 1-10 g/L, and isotherms evaluated the adsorption process to determine the maximum adsorption capacity (Q(max), mg/g). Kinetic studies were performed starting from two different initial concentrations (25 and 50 mg/L) and at a maximum contact time of 48 h. The reusability potential of activated biochar was evaluated by adsorption-desorption cycles. The maximum adsorption capacity obtained with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model was 114.8 mg/g at 300.15 K, pH = 5.4, and a dose of activated biochar of 1.0 g/L. This study also highlights the application of advanced machine learning techniques to optimize a chemical removal process. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset, a Gradient Boosting regression model was developed and fine-tuned using Bayesian optimization within a Python programming environment. The optimization algorithm efficiently navigated the input space to maximize the removal percentage, resulting in a predicted efficiency of approximately 90.47% under optimal conditions. These findings offer promising insights for enhancing efficiency in similar removal processes, showcasing the potential of machine learning in process optimization and environmental remediation.;;9;25;English;"computational thinking; educational innovation; activated biochar; ADSORBENT; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; azo dye; CARBON; COAL; Congo red adsorption; DEGRADATION; EQUILIBRIUM; Haematoxylum campechianum; ISOTHERM; isotherms; KINETICS; PHOTOCATALYSTS; REMOVAL"

Research on LLMs was in the exploratory phase, characterized by discussions and observations rather than empirical investigations. This study presented a framework for incorporating LLMs into Science and Engineering Practice (SEP), utilizing a case study on submarine construction, followed by a four-week quasi-experimental validation. The research employed conditional cluster sampling, selecting two homogeneous natural classes from a middle school in China to serve as the experimental and control groups. The key experimental variable was the inclusion of LLMs in the SEP project. Various validated and self-developed assessment tools were used to measure students' STEM learning outcomes. Statistical analyses, including pre- and post-test paired comparisons within classes and ANCOVA for between-class differences, were performed to evaluate the effects of LLM integration. The results showed that students participating in SEP integrated with LLMs significantly improved their mastery of scientific knowledge, attitudes towards science, perceived usefulness of technology, understanding of engineering, computational thinking skills, and problem-solving abilities. In contrast, students participating in traditional SEP exhibited weaker knowledge acquisition, differences in understanding engineering concepts, and lack of development in computational thinking and problem-solving skills.

However, the educational transformation should be accompanied with a technical process which can be eventually transferred to society to empower environmental education. In this study, carbonaceous material derived from Haematoxylum campechianum (CM-HC) was utilized for removing 3-nitrophenol (3-Nph) from aqueous solutions. The novelty of this research utilizes Haematoxylum campechianum bark and coconut shell, abundant agricultural wastes in Campeche, Mexico, for toxin removal, enhancing the adsorption process through artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms to optimize conditions and maximize the absorption efficiency. CM-HC's surface morphology was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS), BET method, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and pHpzc. Kinetic models including pseudo-first-order (PFO), pseudo-second-order (PSO), and Elovich were applied to fit the data. Adsorption isotherms were determined at varying pH (3-8), adsorbent dosages (2-10 g/L), and temperatures (300.15-330.15 K), employing Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Redlich-Peterson models. PSO kinetics demonstrated a good fit (R-2 > 0.98) for Ci = 50-100 mg/L, indicating a chemical adsorption mechanism. The Langmuir isotherm model exhibited the best fit, confirming chemical adsorption, with a maximum adsorption capacity (Q(m)) of 236.156 mg/g at T = 300.15 K, pH = 6, contact time = 3 h, and 2 g/L adsorbent dosage. Lower temperatures favored exothermic adsorption. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were employed for deep learning, optimizing the predictive model for removal percentage. Correlation heat maps highlighted positive correlations between time, dosage, and removal percentage, emphasizing the impact of initial concentration on efficiency. ANN modeling, incorporating iterative optimization, yielded highly accurate predictions, aligned closely with experimental results. The study showcases the success of deep learning in optimizing adsorption processes, emphasizing the importance of diverse correlation algorithms for comprehensive insights into competitive adsorption dynamics. The 5-14-14-1 deep learning architecture, fine-tuned over 228 epochs, demonstrated strong performance with mean squared error (MSE) values of 4.07, 18.406, and 6.2122 for training, testing, and total datasets, respectively, and high R-squared values. Graphical analysis showed a solid linear correlation between experimental and simulated removal percentages, emphasizing the need to consider more than just testing data for optimization. Experimental validation confirmed a 98.77% removal efficiency, illustrating the effectiveness of combining deep learning with genetic algorithms, and highlighting the necessity of experimental trials to verify computational predictions. It is concluded that the carbonaceous material from Haematoxylum campechianum waste (CM-HC) is an effective, low-cost adsorbent for removing 3-nitrophenol from aqueous solutions, achieving optimal removal at pH 6 and 300. 15 K with a maximum adsorption capacity of 236.156 mg/g, following Langmuir model and pseudo-second order kinetics. The validated ANN model offers a reliable tool for practical applications in environmental remediation, advancing both environmental science and educational innovation by integrating artificial neural networks and data science methodologies into student learning experiences.";;1;14;English;"Artificial intelligence; Computational thinking; Higher education; Educational innovation; Artificial neural network; Deep learning; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; Haematoxylum campechianum; REMOVAL; 3-nitrophenol; ACTIVATED CARBON; Carbonaceous materials; CHLOROPHENOLS; CONGO RED; Genetic algorithm; NITROPHENOLS; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; RHIZOPUS-ARRHIZUS; SUBSTITUTED PHENOLS; WATER"

Yet, providing holistic AI education for upper-primary students remains challenging due to the abstract and complex nature of AI and a lack of pedagogical experiences in schools. Against this backdrop, this study employs a design-based research (DBR) methodology to develop pedagogical solutions and theoretical knowledge. Drawing upon theories about AI literacy and learning sciences, this study proposes a novel pedagogical approach, namely, the embodied constructionist approach. This approach, by integrating embodied analogies and constructionist making, forges a cyclical understand-make-reflect process. Through this process, students gradually comprehend the conceptual, technical, and ethical dimensions of AI, towards holistic development in AI literacy. This approach was implemented and fine-tuned in authentic classrooms with 107 sixth graders over two years. During the implementation, a variety of qualitative data were collected from classroom observation, video-recording, student interviews and artifacts, and debriefings with the teacher. Using a case studies method, this study uncovered the overall learning progress demonstrated by the class in AI knowledge, skills, and ethical and critical reflections, as well as the reflections and struggles experienced by individual students. This study offers an age-appropriate pedagogy to promote inclusive, holistic AI education in the crucial, yet under-examined upper primary context.

Accurately predicting item difficulty during test creation is thus significantly important for producing effective test papers. This study used more than ten years of content and score data from China's Henan Provincial College Entrance Examination in Mathematics as an evaluation criterion for test difficulty, and all data were obtained from the Henan Provincial Department of Education. Based on the framework established by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for test item assessment methodology, this paper proposes a new framework containing eight features considering the uniqueness of mathematics. Next, this paper proposes an XGBoost-based SHAP model for analyzing the difficulty of mathematics tests. By coupling the XGBoost method with the SHAP method, the model not only evaluates the difficulty of mathematics tests but also analyzes the contribution of specific features to item difficulty, thereby increasing transparency and mitigating the ""black box"" nature of machine learning models. The model has a high prediction accuracy of 0.99 for the training set and 0.806 for the test set. With the model, we found that parameter-level features and reasoning-level features are significant factors influencing the difficulty of subjective items in the exam. In addition, we divided senior secondary mathematics knowledge into nine units based on Chinese curriculum standards and found significant differences in the distribution of the eight features across these different knowledge units, which can help teachers place different emphasis on different units during the teaching process. In summary, our proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of item difficulty prediction, which is crucial for intelligent educational applications such as knowledge tracking, automatic test item generation, and intelligent paper generation. These results provide tools that are better aligned with and responsive to students' learning needs, thus effectively informing educational practice.";;10;12;English;"secondary education; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; IMPACT; assessment methods; AUTOMATIC ITEM GENERATION; computer-based assessment; MACHINE; mathematics item difficulty; SHAP; XGBoost"

Employed in digital learning environments, stealth assessment helps researchers, educators, and teachers evaluate learners' competencies and customize the learning experience to their specific needs. This adaptability is closely intertwined with theories related to learning, engagement, and motivation. The foundation of stealth assessment rests on evidence-cantered design (ECD), consisting of four core models: the Competency Model (CM), Evidence Model, Task Model, and Assembly Model.ObjectiveThe first step in designing a stealth assessment entails producing operational definitions of the constructs to be assessed. The CM establishes a framework of latent variables representing the target constructs, as well as their interrelations. When developing the CM, assessment designers must produce clear descriptions of the claims associated with the latent variables and their states, as well as sketch out how the competencies can be measured using assessment tasks. As the designers elaborate on the assessment model, the CM definitions need to be revisited to make sure they work with the scope and constraints of the assessment. Although this is the first step, problems at this stage may result in an assessment that does not meet the intended purpose. The objective of this paper is to elucidate the necessary steps for CM development and to highlight potential challenges in the process, along with strategies for addressing them, particularly for designers without much formal assessment experience.MethodThis paper is a methodological exposition, showcasing five examples of CM development. Specifically, we conducted a qualitative retrospective analysis of the CM development procedure, wherein participants unfamiliar with ECD applied the framework and showcased their work. In a stealth assessment course, four groups of students (novice stealth assessment designers) engaged in developing stealth assessments for challenging-to-measure constructs across four distinct projects. During their CM development process, we observed various activities to pinpoint areas of difficulty.ResultsThis paper presents five illustrative examples, including one for assessing physics understanding and four for the development of CMs for four complex competencies: (1) systems thinking, (2) online information credibility evaluation, (3) computational thinking, and (4) collaborative creativity. Each example represents a case in CM development, offering valuable insights.ConclusionThe paper concludes by discussing several guidelines derived from the examples discussed. Emphasizing the importance of dedicating ample time to fine-tune CMs can significantly enhance the accuracy of assessments related to learners' knowledge and skills. It underscores the significance of qualitative phases in crafting comprehensive stealth assessments, such as CMs, alongside the quantitative statistical modeling and technical aspects of these assessments. What is currently known about this topic? Stealth assessment represents an unobtrusive, automated formative assessment method. This method uses learning analytics within digital learning environments (e.g., games). The main purpose is to assess and foster the competencies of diverse learners.What does this paper add?

Due to the interdisciplinary nature and broad scope of the field, further research is essential to unravel how K-12 students can effectively interact with data through productive learning experiences. This is particularly true in data visualization activities, in which students must employ a variety of skills to effectively extract and communicate data insights. In this study, we describe key actions involved in creating data visualizations using a block-based programming environment (PlayData). Based on qualitative video analysis, we identified six core data visualization programming moves: program creation, selection of parameters, output inspection, data inspection, program rearrangement, and visual design. Then, using learning analytics techniques and Epistemic Network Analysis, we developed a method for automatically categorizing and characterizing those moves based on fine-grained log data collected from the environment, which allowed the identification of patterns in students' trajectories. We found that students' work is distributed across several micro-tasks, each involving distinct types of interaction with the environment and holding a unique value in the process of engaging in programming, data analysis, and visual design. As students progress, there is a transition among these moves, suggesting the need for activities that ensure comprehensive exposure to all of them. Our study presents two main contributions: a novel approach to automatically categorize and describe learning trajectories in open-ended programming tasks and insights into how K-12 students engage with those tasks in a data-related context, laying a foundation for better supporting learning and research in this emergent area.;;;;English;"Computational thinking; K-12; SCIENCE; LITERACY; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; Clustering; LEARNING ANALYTICS; Learning analytics; Data science education; Data visualization; Epistemic Network Analysis"

Data were collected from 109 Chinese high school students who engaged in programming tasks using either ChatGPT-driven dialogic interaction or traditional pair programming. A quasi-experimental analysis revealed that ChatGPT-based programming activities remarkably boost student engagement, outperforming pair programming in behavioral, cognitive, and emotional dimensions. Results demonstrated that such activities help minimize off-task behaviors, promote higher-order cognitive skills, and foster greater interest in programming. Additionally, these interactions enhance students' self-efficacy and reduce learning anxiety. The findings underscore the potential of ChatGPT-driven dialogic interaction in programming education.

It is however important to ascertain how the mathematics courses impact the programming skills of the students. This article examines the impact of mathematics ancillary courses on the Computational Programming Intelligence (CPI) of Computer Science and Engineering students. Using the results of Computer Science students on mathematics and programming courses for seven (7) sessions, Random forest regression and K-means clustering machine learning models were used to study the relationship between the ancillary courses and their performance in programming courses. A Pearson correlation coefficient was computed to assess the linear relationship between five (5) Mathematics ancillary courses and the programming courses. A significant positive correlation (0.29, 0.27, 0.20, 0.10, and 0.09, p = 0.02) was obtained with Linear algebra having the highest and Mathematical methods the least. Consequently, variable importance results show that linear algebra had the highest impact on CPI while Mathematical methods had the least in the following order (29.11%, 20.39%, 19.80%, 17.15%, and 13.55%). Mostly female students of age range 19-20 were found to have been positively impacted more by the mathematics courses.

Consequences for Intelligent Learning and Educational Evaluation""";RED-REVISTA DE EDUCACION A DISTANCIA;1578-7680;10.6018/red.609801;In July 2023, given the rise of LLMs (Large Langauge Models), RED convened this special issue on Generative AI and Education, where special attention was paid to its consequences for intelligent learning and educational evaluation. We wanted to give space to contributions that included research related to these topics. Also to experiences about intelligent learning and formative evaluation in ChatGPT contexts. The call was with these general questions center dot Does AI have the potential to revolutionize existing teaching methods, assessment and student support? center dot Creative thinking and problem solving are essential in modern and very complex environments. Could this AI help students deal with these problems? We also had doubts about its benefits. They could be summarized in this question: Generative AI will begin to serve as an active partner in social, creative and intellectual actions continuously over time, and not only as an answer to isolated questions: What are the impacts that will occur? Now those impacts are unknown in the practices that may exist. Another intention was: A theoretical framework is needed to address these questions and in general for an effective deployment of AI systems in education. It is necessary to do so beyond the results provided by empirical research. And that it does not guide and direct at new crossroads, both in research and practice. In the conclusions we see to what extent these expectations have been met. As a consequence, we deduce that the critical importance of theory in the design, development and deployment of AI in education is necessary now more than ever. But we are equally underserved. In this perspective, we continue to critically consider the relevance and continuity of existing learning theories when AI becomes a reality in classrooms. As that result is not met, we also reiterate the call to consider new frameworks, models and ways of thinking. We are referring to those that include the presence of non -human agents, which we hesitate to call a new technology, because it is more like an active partner than a simple technology, as has happened until now. This approach is precisely what makes us insist on a series of important questions for the future, precisely about the review of learning theories based on existing configurations. And to investigate what their alternatives would be in this case. We have done after extensive and exhaustive dissemination in your call. But, despite this and beyond these general conclusions that we have made, the special issue offers us evidence of a scarce empirical investigation of practical cases in the application of generative AI in education. However, of the hundred or so contributions received, seven have been selected in the previous editorial review. The rest have been discarded because they do not conform to the standards or are not the type of contributions requested (the literature reviews per se and the self-report studies stand out among them, due to their high number). Of those seven, six have passed editorial review. They are described at the end. The main contributions of this small number of contributions have been the confirmation of a low level of research and practice. Also, some very interesting contributions from the articles and essays by the invited authors. We draw your attention to these articles and the clear results and evidence obtained on the concrete use of generative AI in specific environments. Results of inevitable use by schools, universities and teachers in these environments or in others to which they can be transferred.;;78;24;English;"artificial intelligence; instructional design; ChatGPT; education; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; Generative AI; assessment"

Computer-aided approaches to inquiry have gained important ground in educational research, mostly through data analytics and large data set processing. We argue that qualitative data analysis methods can also be supported and extended by computer-aided methods. In particular, we posit that computing capacities rationally applied can expand the innate human ability to recognize patterns and group qualitative information based on similarities. We propose a principled approach to using machine learning in qualitative education research based on the three interrelated elements of the assessment triangle: cognition, observation, and interpretation. Through the lens of the assessment triangle, the study presents three examples of qualitative studies in engineering education that have used computer-aided methods for visualization and grouping. The first study focuses on characterizing students' written explanations of programming code, using tile plots and hierarchical clustering with binary distances to identify the different approaches that students used to self-explain. The second study looks into students' modeling and simulation process and elicits the types of knowledge that they used in each step through a think-aloud protocol. For this purpose, we used a bubble plot and a k-means clustering algorithm. The third and final study explores engineering faculty's conceptions of teaching, using data from semi-structured interviews. We grouped these conceptions based on coding similarities, using Jaccard's similarity coefficient, and visualized them using a treemap. We conclude this manuscript by discussing some implications for engineering education qualitative research.;;5;32;English;"SCIENCE; machine learning; CONCEPTIONS; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; visualization; data analysis; assessment triangle; ASSESSMENT TRIANGLE; clustering algorithms; computer-aided methods; DEVELOP; education research; qualitative methods"

This ability involves employing appropriate algorithms and computer codes to solve problems and can be enhanced through practical learning. However, in a formal educational setting, it is challenging to provide personalized support to students during their practice owing to limited teacher availability and large class sizes. The integration of large language model-based programming learning environments (LPLEs) is a promising approach to this issue as this setting supports adaptive learning by providing feedback on student codes and responses to questions with human-like interactions. However, a research gap exists regarding the efficacy of LPLEs. To address this gap, this study integrated an LPLE for first-year high school students in South Korea engaged in learning programming for the first time as part of the national curriculum. We examined the impact of the LPLE using a mixed-methods approach with a quasi-experimental design through the lens of self-determination theory. We also investigated students' learning behaviors within the LPLE and their perceptions of how specific elements of the LPLE satisfy their basic psychological needs. The results provide evidence that the LPLE supports students' basic psychological needs, enhances autonomous motivation, and improves programming ability. Based on these findings, implications regarding effective utilization and development of the LPLE are discussed from a theoretical and practical perspective.;8109-8138;6;30;English;"SKILLS; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; Large language models; Programming education; SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY; Motivation; Programming ability; Self-determination theory"

Given the intrinsic complexity of LLMs, effective prompting is not as straightforward as anticipated which highlights the need for novel educational and support methods that are both widely accessible and seamlessly integrated into task workflows. However, LLM prompting shows strong dependence on the specific task and domain, reducing the usefulness of generic methods. We intend to investigate if LLM-based methods can support learning assessments using ad-hoc guidelines and an extremely limited number of annotated prompt samples. In our framework, guidelines are transformed into features to be detected in the learners' prompts. The descriptions of these features, together with annotated sample prompts, are used to create few-shot learning detectors. We compare various configurations of these few-shot detectors testing 3 state-of-the-art LLMs and derived ensemble models. Our experiments are performed using cross-validation on original sample prompts and a specifically collected test set of prompts from task-naive learners. We find a strong impact of the LLMs on our feature list. One of the most recent models, GPT-4, shows promising performance on most of the features. However, some closely connected models (GPT-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo (Instruct)) show different behaviors when classifying features. We highlight the need for further research in light of the possible impact of design choices on the selection of features and detection prompts.

However, developing effective serious games is complex, and a more systematic approach is needed to create better evidence-based games. Learning analytics-based on the analysis of collected in-game user interactions-can support game development and the players' learning process, providing assessment information to teachers, students, and other stakeholders. However, empirical studies applying and demonstrating the use of learning analytics in the context of serious games in real environments remain scarce. In this paper, we study the application of learning analytics throughout the whole lifecycle of a serious game, in order to assess the game's design and players' learning using a serious game that introduces basic programming concepts through a visual programming language. The game was played by N = 134 high school students in two 50-min sessions. During the game sessions, all player interactions were collected, including the time spent solving levels, their programming solutions, and the number of replays. We analyzed these interaction traces to gain insights that can facilitate teachers' use of serious games in their lessons and assessments, as well as guide developers in making possible improvements to the game. Among these insights, knowing which tasks students struggle with is critical for both teachers and game developers, and can also reveal game design issues. Among the results obtained through analysis of the interaction data, we found differences between boys and girls when playing. Girls play in a more reflexive way and, in terms of acceptance of the game, a higher percentage of girls had neutral opinions. We also found the most repeated errors, the level each player reached, and how long it took them to reach those levels. These data will help to make further improvements to the game's design, resulting in a more effective educational tool in the future. The process and results of this study can guide other researchers when applying learning analytics to evaluate and improve the educational design of serious games, as well as supporting teachers-both during and after the game activity-in applying an evidence-based assessment of the players based on the collected learning analytics.;;4;14;English;"computational thinking; learning analytics; programming learning; visual programming; PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS; serious games"

However, for programming beginners such as primary and secondary school students, learning programming is not a simple task and requires additional learning support. Generative AI (GenAI) chatbots are effective teaching aids that can reduce the learning difficulty of programming by providing real-time guidance and personalized learning support based on students' abilities. Therefore, it has been a trend to apply GenAI chatbots in teaching. However, technology always has two sides. Over-reliance on these chatbots may weaken students' ability to think independently and affect their learning effectiveness. Therefore, how to rationally utilize GenAI chatbots in the classroom and improve their application effectiveness has become an important issue for both researchers and frontline teachers. Based on this, the present study proposed a learning method that integrates mind mapping with GenAI chatbots. To assess the effectiveness of this learning method and to investigate whether there are differences in the impact of various types of mind mapping-supported GenAI chatbots on students' programming academic performance, computational thinking, and programming self-efficacy, the research team conducted a quasi-experimental study. The participants were 111 seventh-grade students at a junior high school in southeastern China. Experimental Group 1 (36 students) used a learning approach that integrated progressive mind maps with a Generative AI chatbot, Experimental Group 2 (36 students) used a learning approach that integrated self-constructed mind maps with a GenAI chatbot, and the control group (39 students) used a traditional AI chatbot-based learning approach. The results showed that participants in both experimental groups had significantly better programming learning performance as well as computational thinking than the control group, and that the learning method integrating progressive mind mapping with GenAI chatbots was more effective.;;1;12;English;"KNOWLEDGE; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; SYSTEM; MAP"

The essence of social singularity is generally interpreted in the context of the coevolution of nature and society in the conditions of rapid technological shifts and changes in the role of the information environment. Therefore, this study aims to define and analyze the methodological tools of cognition of the social singularity phenomenon as a structural part of the new digital paradigm of philosophical discourse. The article considers the methodological approaches of various schools of philosophy represented by opposing views on anthropological reality in the context of its digital transformation.Within the framework of methodological structuring, the degree of the social singularity issue elaboration can be represented by the methodologies of postmodern and post-humanism philosophy. The conceptual approaches to the criticism of computational thinking, which forms the phenomenon of singularity eliminating the Human, are presented in the works by Baudrillard, Deleuze, Massumi, and Haraway. The article emphasizes that the papers of these scholars study digital ontology of the post-human state, where the boundaries between man and machine are blurred. Those studies include the analysis of cyber and biotechnological changes that affect human nature and create the concept of social singularity as a negative scenario for the development of the Human. Analyzing the phenomenon of social singularity, we emphasize that non-objectified human feelings come into conflict with computational thinking, since subjectivity, carried beyond the limits of the Self, turns into the non-human Other. Therefore, the article raises the question of how algorithms and artificial intelligence affect human subjectivity and free will; hence, the understanding of how computational processes can limit or expand human capabilitiesare of crucial importance.";17-28;1;16;English;"computational thinking; consciousness; digital ontology; free will; social singularity"

However, progress has been limited, and the female presence is still low in certain degrees related to information and communication technologies, physics, and engineering. Many of the actions have been aimed at attracting women to these fields, but few have tried to change the culture of these disciplines, which make them a non-place for women. This paper analyses the measures carried out in Spanish public universities, and specifically at the University of Santiago de Compostela, to contribute to making these disciplines a place for women. Computer engineering workshops for primary and secondary education are proposed, incorporating a gender perspective. These transformative activities were highly valuated and welcomed by non-university teachers.

To better understand how these subjects are communicated, this study investigates the linguistic structures embedded in academic texts from selected subfields within both disciplines. In particular, we focus on meta-languages-the linguistic tools used to express definitions, axioms, intuitions, and heuristics within a discipline. The primary objective of this research is to identify which subfields of Mathematics and Computer Science share similar meta-languages. Identifying such correspondences may enable the rephrasing of content from less familiar subfields using styles that students already recognize from more familiar areas, thereby enhancing accessibility and comprehension. To pursue this aim, we compiled text corpora from multiple subfields across both disciplines. We compared their meta-languages using a combination of supervised (Neural Network) and unsupervised (clustering) learning methods. Specifically, we applied several clustering algorithms-K-means, Partitioning around Medoids (PAM), Density-Based Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models-to analyze inter-discipline similarities. To validate the resulting classifications, we used XLNet, a deep learning model known for its sensitivity to linguistic patterns. The model achieved an accuracy of 78% and an F1-score of 0.944.

Bayes' theorem is taken as a crucial statistical instrument employed in the development of intelligent systems and the management of risks, commonly utilized by engineers for tasks in machine learning and managerial decision-making. The fundamental concept behind Bayes' theorem revolves around comprehending the degree of truth within the confines of an explicit perspective. This involves partitioning the entire sample space of possible evidence and utilizing the subset containing the relevant perspective to estimate the uncertainty of an event or the reliability of a model. However, it is often found difficult for students to understand Bayes' theorem to the level of applying it to real-world problems. Considering this, the proposed learning method in this paper elucidated the acquisition of Bayes' mathematical formulation by leveraging computational thinking, leading to the development of a computational model. The proposed model is named the Bayesian Computational Learning Model (BCLM). Subsequently, we have probed the utility of BCLM in the design and plan of learning activities, coherent to the STEM paradigm and BT cognitive learning hierarchy.;91217-91228;;12;English;"computational thinking; Problem-solving; machine learning; Computational modeling; Engineering education; Taxonomy; STEM; engineering education; Bayes' theorem; Bloom's taxonomy; computer simulations; decision making; frequentist; intelligent systems design; project management; risk analysis; Bayes methods; BayesÕ theorem; BloomÕs taxonomy; Computer simulation; Intelligent systems; Mathematical models; Probability; Project management; Risk management"

However, the desired outcomes have not been consistently achieved. This study aims to analyze the perspectives of students and professionals from non-computational fields on the use of generative AI tools, augmented with visualization support, to tackle data analytics projects. The focus is on promoting the development of coding skills and fostering a deep understanding of the solutions generated. Consequently, our research seeks to introduce innovative approaches for incorporating visualization and generative AI tools into educational practices.Methods This article examines how learners perform and their perspectives when using traditional tools vs. LLM-based tools to acquire data analytics skills. To explore this, we conducted a case study with a cohort of 59 participants among students and professionals without computational thinking skills. These participants developed a data analytics project in the context of a Data Analytics short session. Our case study focused on examining the participants' performance using traditional programming tools, ChatGPT, and LIDA with GPT as an advanced generative AI tool.Results The results shown the transformative potential of approaches based on integrating advanced generative AI tools like GPT with specialized frameworks such as LIDA. The higher levels of participant preference indicate the superiority of these approaches over traditional development methods. Additionally, our findings suggest that the learning curves for the different approaches vary significantly. Since learners encountered technical difficulties in developing the project and interpreting the results. Our findings suggest that the integration of LIDA with GPT can significantly enhance the learning of advanced skills, especially those related to data analytics. We aim to establish this study as a foundation for the methodical adoption of generative AI tools in educational settings, paving the way for more effective and comprehensive training in these critical areas.Discussion It is important to highlight that when using general-purpose generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, users must be aware of the data analytics process and take responsibility for filtering out potential errors or incompleteness in the requirements of a data analytics project. These deficiencies can be mitigated by using more advanced tools specialized in supporting data analytics tasks, such as LIDA with GPT. However, users still need advanced programming knowledge to properly configure this connection via API. There is a significant opportunity for generative AI tools to improve their performance, providing accurate, complete, and convincing results for data analytics projects, thereby increasing user confidence in adopting these technologies. We hope this work underscores the opportunities and needs for integrating advanced LLMs into educational practices, particularly in developing computational thinking skills.;;;9;English;"ChatGPT; higher education; educational innovation; data analytics learning; generative AI tools; large language models in education; professional education; programming skills development"

Method: The sample of the study represented the population, which was digital skills textbooks for the middle school in Saudi Arabia. The study adopted a descriptive data content analysis approach, and relied on Porter's model to measure alignment on two dimensions: content areas and cognitive levels, through variables namely, content of digital skills and technology textbooks; national standards of learning digital technology for the middle stage; and SOLO taxonomy. The data of the variables were analyzed through frequencies and percentages, and then Porter's equation was applied to find alignment between them. Results: The results revealed that there was no alignment between the content of the digital technology textbooks for the middle school with the national standards of digital technology learning. This was due to a different focus of content areas in the following branches: programming, computational thinking, artificial intelligence, digital citizenship, and cybersecurity. Conclusion: At the cognitive levels, a weakness was found in expanded thinking skills, associative thinking, and the focus of the content areas on the level of mulsti-structuring thinking, which is considered a beginner level. Policy Implication: In the light of these results, the study recommends reviewing the content of the textbooks in accordance with the recommendations provided, to ensure its alignment with the standard documents and focusing on the levels of expansive and associative thinking of cognitive levels.

The contribution of the paper is fourfold. First, future readers can use this paper as a reference point for exploring the expected learning outcomes of educational robotics. From an exhaustive list of potential learning gains, we propose a set of six learning outcomes that can offer a starting point for a viable model for the design of robotic activities. Second, the paper aims to serve as a survey for the most recent ER platforms. Driven by the growing number of available robotics platforms, we have gathered the most recent ER kits. We also propose a new way to categorize the platforms, free from their manufacturers' vague age boundaries. The proposed categories, including No Code, Basic Code, and Advanced Code, are derived from the prior knowledge and the programming skills that a student needs to use them efficiently. Third, as the number of ER competitions, and tournaments increases in parallel with ER platforms' increase, the paper presents and analyses the most popular robotic events. Robotics competitions encourage participants to develop and showcase their skills while promoting specific learning outcomes. The paper aims to provide an overview of those structures and discuss their efficacy. Finally, the paper explores the educational aspects of the presented ER competitions and their correlation with the six proposed learning outcomes. This raises the question of which primary features compose a competition and achieve its' pedagogical goals.

It is an effective way to reveal the information literacy teaching mechanism to use the rich and diverse information literacy learning behavior characteristics to carry out the learning effect prediction analysis. This paper analyzes the characteristics of college students' learning behaviors and explores the predictive learning effect by constructing a predictive model of learning effect based on information literacy learning behavior characteristics. The experiment used 320 college students' information literacy learning data from Chinese university.

H3C2FTZJ;journalArticle;2021;"Sun, D; Ouyang, F; Li, Y; Zhu, CF";Comparing learners' knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes between two instructional modes of computer programming in secondary education;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION;2196-7822;10.1186/s40594-021-00311-1;Background Unplugged programming is proved to be an effective means to foster the learner-centered programming learning. In addition to the final tests, learners' programming knowledge, skills, and capacities are primarily demonstrated throughout the programming process, particularly in the situation when they encounter challenges and problems. However, few studies examine how learners engage in the programming processes and to what extent unplugged programming fosters learning. This research used a quasi-experimental design to investigate two instructional modes in China's secondary education, namely, the instructor-directed lecturing and the learner-centered unplugged programming. Based on an analytical framework, this research used mixed methods to compare learners' knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes under these two instructional modes. Results The research results revealed discrepancies between two instructional modes. First, learners in the unplugged programming class achieved significantly higher scores on the programming knowledge assessment, compared to learners in the traditional lecturing class. Second, compared to the traditional lecturing class, learners in the unplugged programming class had higher test scores of the computational thinking skills, particularly on the cooperativity dimension. Next, discrepancies of in-class behaviors showed that learners in the unplugged programming class had frequent behaviors of listening to the instructor's instructions and discussing with peers, while learners in the instructor-directed class had frequent behaviors of listening to instructor, taking notes, and irrelevant activities. Learners' self-reported attitudes in the unplugged programming indicated a higher level of confidence than learners in the traditional lecturing class. Overall, this research revealed that the learner-centered unplugged programming had potential to improve learners' programming knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes compared to the traditional instructor-directed lecturing of programming. Conclusions As a feasible and easy-to-use instructional activity in computer science education, unplugged programming is encouraged to be integrated in formal education to increase learners' programming interests, motivations, and qualities. This quasi-experimental research compared learners' programming knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes under two instructional modes. The results revealed critical discrepancies between two instructional modes on learners' knowledge gains, in-class behaviors, and changes of attitudes towards programming.

Stealth assessment analyzes a stream of fine-grained student interaction data from a game-based learning environment to dynamically draw inferences about students' competencies through evidence-centered design. In evidence-centered design, evidence models have been traditionally designed using statistical rules authored by domain experts that are encoded using Bayesian networks. This article presents DeepStealth, a deep learning-based stealth assessment framework, that yields significant reductions in the feature engineering labor that has previously been required to create stealth assessments. DeepStealth utilizes end-to-end trainable deep neural network-based evidence models. Using this framework, evidence models are devised using a set of predictive features captured from raw, low-level interaction data to infer evidence for competencies. We investigate two deep learning-based evidence models, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). We compare these models' predictive performance for inferring students' knowledge to linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) and naive Bayes models. We perform feature set-level analyses of game trace logs and external pre-learning measures, and we examine the models' early prediction capacity. The framework is evaluated using data collected from 182 middle school students interacting with a game-based learning environment for middle grade computational thinking. Results indicate that LSTM-based stealth assessors outperform competitive baseline approaches with respect to predictive accuracy and early prediction capacity. We find that LSTMs, FFNNs, and CRFs all benefit from combined feature sets derived from both game trace logs and external pre-learning measures.;312-325;2;13;English;"PERFORMANCE; Computational thinking; STUDENTS; Artificial Intelligence; deep learning; Task analysis; Computational modeling; Games; educational games; game-based learning; Adaptation models; Predictive models; stealth assessment; Computer science; Hidden Markov models; Computation; Thinking Skills; Game Based Learning; Middle School Students; Predictor Variables; Educational Environment; Student Evaluation; Models; Bayesian Statistics; stealth assessment."

RTC overcomes challenges related to non-collocated group work, thus lowering barriers to cross-region and multi-user collaborative software development. An empirical study probed into the differential impact on self-efficacy and collaborative behavior of learners in the environment depending upon their disciplinary background. The study serves as an example of the use of learning analytics to explore the frequent behavior patterns of adult learners, in this case specifically while performing BBP in MAI integrated with RTC. This study compares behavior patterns that are collaborative or individual that occurred on the platform, and investigates the effects of collaboration on learners working within the RTC depending on whether they were CS-majors or not. We highlight advantages of the new MAI design during multi-user programming in the online RTC based on the connections between the interface design and BBP as illustrated by two significant behavior patterns found in this instructional experiment. First, the multi-user programming in the RTC allowed multiple tasks to happen at the same time, which promoted engagement in joint behavior. For example, one user arranged components in the interface design while another dragged blocks to complete the program. Second, this study confirmed that the Computer Programming Self-Efficacy (CPSE) was similar for individual and multi-user programming overall. The CPSE of the homogeneous CS-major groups engaged in programming within the RTC was higher than that of the homogeneous non-CS-major groups and heterogeneous groups. There was no significant difference between the CPSE of the homogenous non-CS group and the CPSE of the heterogeneous groups, regardless of whether they were engaged in individual programming or collaborative programming within their groups. The results of the study support the value of engaging with MAI collaboratively, especially for CS-majors, and suggest directions for future work in RTC design.;559-582;4;16;English;"TEACHER; SCIENCE; MODEL; SKILLS; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; Learning analytics; Behavior and sequential analysis; Block-based programming learning; MIT App Inventor; Online real-time collaboration"

However, effective ways of engaging beginners in programming in K-12 are still unclear, especially among low socioeconomic status learners in technology-deprived learning environments. Understanding the learning path of novice programmers will bridge this gap and explain what constitutes an effective learning path for novice. Thirty-eight students from technology-deprived schools participated in a 10-h project-first constructionist learning. Using the Friedman test of repeated measures and Spearman's rank correlation, trends in the students' programming ability were evaluated. The findings showed that the students' programming ability increased on the first day, remained stable throughout the intervention, and were not affected by either semantics or syntax of the Python programming language. However, the features of a program were inconclusive determinants of programming skills. The irregular patterns of programming concepts within and between the learners' programming solutions suggest focusing on pedagogies that encourage project-first learning.

In this context, the ""Riconnessioni'' project was promoted by the Compagnia di San Paolo in agreement with the Ministry of Education but planned, started and developed by the Foundation for the School. The digital transformation started with a defined strategy that leveraged opportunities presented by new technology while meeting the objectives of system stakeholders. Through several steps, that strategy was developed for education connecting everything to support tomorrow's digital world and creating strong strategic partnerships able to build an ecosystem connecting people, processes, and things into a powerful, secure, and smart communications network. This paper reports on the three-year Riconnessioni project, which is combining the energies of teachers, managers, administrative staff, students, among others, and experimenting with new learning models, taking advantage of opportunities that emerged from perceptions stemming from concerns and systemic issues. To date, more than 150 schools in Italy have been included in the project, together with 550 teachers selected to scale up the instructional process. Using a methodology called ""cascade training'', the 550 selected teachers were able to spread the knowledge to more than 2,600 colleagues. The monitoring and evaluation activity performed in Riconnessioni aims at processing information on implementation and results, following three lines. First, it regularly evaluates project activities from a reporting standpoint. Second, it verifies the plan consistency against implementation achievements. Third, it identifies changes produced and focuses on teachers' and students' skills to evaluate the effects of the project.

However, little research has focused on the student experience of these courses: what pedagogic practices make learning coding meaningful for them and why. In a previous paper, we proposed a conceptual framework outlining three dimensions of learning opportunities in relation to coding: functional, collaborative, and critical & creative. The aim of the current paper is to characterise the pedagogic practices and learning outcomes highlighted by university coding bootcamp students as beneficial and then explore how they might map on to the dimensions in this framework. This study uses a mixed method design with quantitative and qualitative data from a sample of 36 students attending a Summer School in Coding, Data Analytics and Machine Learning. We use thematic analysis to describe how three main pedagogic approaches - guided hands-on, peer teaming and contextualisation - were experienced by learners. The study suggests that mapping pedagogic practices to the dimensions of the framework can be of value to those designing courses to suit the diverse interests of students seeking an introduction to coding.;578-595;4;18;English;"SKILLS; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; Coding; CODE; bootcamps; learning opportunities; pedagogic practices"

Through data analytics techniques, the authors will explore the activities' output from a pedagogical and quantitative point of view. Sensors are utilized in the context of an Educational Robotics activity to obtain a more effective robot-environment interaction. Pupils work on specific exercises to make their robot smarter and to carry out more complex and inspirational projects: the integration of sensors on a robotic prototype is crucial, and learners have to comprehend how to use them. In the presented study, the potential of Educational Data Mining is used to investigate how a group of primary and secondary school students, using visual programming (Lego Mindstorms EV3 Education software), design programming sequences while they are solving an exercise related to an ultrasonic sensor mounted on their robotic artifact. For this purpose, a tracking system has been designed so that every programming attempt performed by students' teams is registered on a log file and stored in an SD card installed in the Lego Mindstorms EV3 brick. These log files are then analyzed using machine learning techniques (k-means clustering) in order to extract different patterns in the creation of the sequences and extract various problem-solving pathways performed by students. The difference between problem-solving pathways with respect to an indicator of early achievement is studied.;;;7;English;"learning analytics; SKILLS; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; educational robotics; ANALYTICS; educational data mining; learning process identification; STEM activities assessment"

Teaching lessons with technology-based activities rather than the traditional teaching method is an obligation for teachers. For this reason, teachers need resources whose validity and reliability are tested that they can use in their lessons. In this study, a part of the technology content resource that teachers need for a biology lesson is presented. While preparing the course contents, a STEM approach including science, engineering, mathematics and technology disciplines was used. A significant increase was found in the ability of the students to whom the developed activities were applied to establish cause and effect relationships. According to this result, it can be said that Arduino-supported STEM education improves students' abilities to establish cause and effect relationships. Considering that generations that have grown up in the 21st-century have grown alongside technology, it is thought that integrating technology into lessons helps students learn the subject. This study aims to develop five STEM activities for the lesson of the human body systems by integrating the coding-based Arduino into STEM education. The activities were implemented to 6th-grade students for seven weeks and the effects on students' skills of establishing a cause-effect relationship. The study method was pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental design, and the cause-effect relationship scale and semi-structured view form were used as data collection tools. As a result of the study, a significant difference was found between the Arduino-supported STEM activities developed and the students' skills of establishing a cause-effect relationship. The students who received the Arduino-supported STEM education found the course to be entertaining and educational, and the future goals of these students were affected. In order to bring individuals who love their profession into the future, Arduino-supported STEM education should be applied and expanded in other branches and class levels.;;6;10;English;"computational thinking; CHALLENGES; LEARNING ANALYTICS; STEM; 21st century skills; Arduino; critical thinking; thinking skills"

Although it is traditionally associated with arts and literature, it can also be developed as part of computing education. Therefore, this article -presents a systematic mapping of approaches for assessing creativity based on the analysis of computer programs created by the students. As result, only ten approaches reported in eleven articles have been encountered. These reveal the absence of a commonly accepted definition of product creativity customized to computer education, confirming only originality as one of the well-established characteristics. Several approaches seem to lack clearly defined criteria for effective, efficient and useful creativity assessment. Diverse techniques are used including rubrics, mathematical models and machine learning, supporting manual and automated approaches. Few performed a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach regarding their reliability and validity. These results can help instructors to choose and adopt assessment approaches and guide researchers by pointing out shortcomings.;19-45;1;20;English;"programming; K-12; STUDENTS; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; creativity; assessment; computing; NOVELTY; product creativity; systematic mapping"

In the noise-free case, when a halfspace consistent with all the training examples exists, the problem can be solved in polynomial time using linear programming. However, under the promise that a halfspace consistent with a fraction (1 - epsilon) of the examples exists (for some small constant epsilon > 0), it was not known how to efficiently find a halfspace that is correct on even 51% of the examples. Nor was a hardness result that ruled out getting agreement on more than 99.9% of the examples known. In this work, we close this gap in our understanding and prove that even a tiny amount of worst-case noise makes the problem of learning halfspaces intractable in a strong sense. Specifically, for arbitrary epsilon, delta > 0, we prove that given a set of examples-label pairs from the hypercube, a fraction (1 - epsilon) of which can be explained by a halfspace, it is NP-hard to find a halfspace that correctly labels a fraction (1/2 + delta) of the examples. The hardness result is tight since it is trivial to get agreement on 1/2 the examples. In learning theory parlance, we prove that weak proper agnostic learning of halfspaces is hard. This settles a question that was raised by Blum et al., in their work on learning halfspaces in the presence of random classification noise [Algorithmica, 22 (1998), pp. 35-52], and raised by authors of some more recent works as well. Along the way, we also obtain a strong hardness result for another basic computational problem: solving a linear system over the rationals.;742-765;2;39;English;"ALGORITHM; computational learning; hardness of approximation; perceptron"

Enthusiastic, intelligent, and well-educated science teachers inspire and prepare students to investigate the great questions of science and the questions raised by the scientific discoveries which affect us and our society. Teaching science in schools is undergoing a major transformation today with the advent of technology and ever-increasing focus on providing sufficient time and opportunity for students to perform experiments and conduct activities in the classrooms in order to promote a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. This paper focusses on three important aspects that are changing the nature of Indian Science classrooms, these are (a) Technology-Supported Classrooms (b) Mobile Learning and (c) Setting up of Tinkering Labs in schools. The effective and appropriate integration of technology in the science classroom creates a dynamic learning environment where students are active participants in the learning process and therefore, science teachers are now matching the appropriate use of technology with content to maximize the student's potential in learning. Students in schools are also being allowed to take the digital interactive science content home and are increasingly using mobile learning devices such as tablets and smartphones to learn at their own pace and time. Apart from focussing on digital-learning, schools are also setting up Tinkering Labs to foster curiosity, creativity and imagination in students; and inculcate skills such as design mindset, computational thinking, adaptive learning and physical computing, etc. These Labs provide a workspace where young students can give shape to their ideas through hands-on do-it-yourself mode; and will get a chance to work with tools and equipment to understand the concepts of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). Tinkering Labs contain educational and learning 'do it yourself' kits and equipment on-science, electronics, robotics, open source microcontroller boards, sensors and 3D printers and computers.";;;;English;

The application of co-design pedagogical techniques has the potential to improve students' CT learning through knowledge sharing and the creation of ideas to solve problems and develop an artifact. However, there is a limited understanding of how co-design pedagogical techniques have been explored to foster CT learning, which could hamper the successful use of co-design as a pragmatic teaching approach. This study examined the ways in which co-design pedagogical techniques have been applied in CT education by implementing a systematic literature review (PRISMA protocol) to document the review analysis. A total of 26 articles that met the inclusion criteria for this study were reviewed.

In this paper, a novel metaheuristic called the deep sleep optimiser (DSO) is proposed. The deep sleep optimiser mimics the sleeping patterns of humans to solve optimisation problems. The DSO is modelled on the rise and fall of homeostatic pressure during the human sleep process. Human sleep is often modelled on the four sleep stages and the deep sleep stage is employed in this work. The mathematical model of sleep homeostatic pressure is employed to simulate and determine the deep sleep state. The performance of DSO is demonstrated by employing 23 traditional functions (i.e., unimodal, multimodal, and fixed multi-modal functions), six composite functions, three engineering design problems, two knapsack problems, and six widely known travelling salesmanÕs problems. Additionally, the performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational running time, the Wilcoxon rank sum, and the Friedman test. Lastly, the DSO is compared with 11 other metaheuristics, including GA, PSO, TLBO, and GWO. The DSO fares comparably well and, in most instances, it outperforms other metaheuristics.;83639-83665;;11;;"deep sleep; Evolution (biology); Genetic algorithms; metaheuristics; Metaheuristics; Muscles; non-REM; Optimisation; Optimization; Rapid eye movement sleep; REM; Search problems; Sleep; Sociology"

Nevertheless, these models have been focused on essential adherence to their integration as coding assistants in computing education. However, attention has been switched to thoroughly examining and analyzing LLM behavior, particularly in computing education for programming tasks such as code generation, code explanation, and programming error message explanation. Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand their behavior to examine potential pitfalls. This article addresses this gap systematically and details how different LLM-based coding chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Codex, Copilot, and others, react to various coding inputs within computing education. To achieve this objective, we collected and analyzed articles from 2021 to 2024, and 72 studies were thoroughly examined. These objectives include investigating the existing limitations and challenges associated with utilizing these systems for coding tasks, assessing their responses to prompts containing coding syntax, examining the impact of their output on student learning, and evaluating their performance as debugging tools. The findings of this review highlight that it is premature to incorporate these systems into computing education due to their limitations that may limit their effectiveness as comprehensive coding assistants for computer science students. These limitations include issues with handling prompts containing code snippets, potential negative impacts on student learning, limited debugging capabilities, and other ineffectiveness.

As such, an increasing number of bachelor's and master's programs outside of the CS discipline integrate CT courses within their study program. At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge. Furthermore, gamifying computational notebooks can serve as a strong driver of active learning engagement, even more so than initial motivational factors.;392-405;3;15;;"Education; Programming profession; Codes; computational thinking (CT); Encoding; Games; gamification; Active learning; Python; computational notebooks; fieldwork learning; Hybrid learning; motivation"

However, intruders find such complex and distributed infrastructures appealing targets for cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are severe threats that can jeopardize the quality of service provided to clients and compromise data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Cyber-attacks are becoming more complex, making it more challenging to detect intrusions effectively. Due to the high traffic and increased malicious activities on the Internet, a single Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be overwhelmed. Despite the various Deep Learning (DL) approaches that have been proposed as alternative solutions, there are still pertinent security issues to be addressed especially in federated cloud computing domains. This work proposes a Secure Federated Intrusion Detection Model Version 1 (SecFedIDM-V1) using blockchain technology and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The Cobourg Intrusion Detection Dataset (CIDDS) was acquired, pre-processed and split into 60:20:20, 70:15:15, and 80:10:10 for training, testing, and validation respectively to develop the proposed intrusion traffic classification component of the proposed model. The developed SecFedIDM-V1 was later deployed as a Python-based web application that captures network packets for classifying attacks into normal or an attack type. The attack packets are recorded in a Hyperledger Fabric (a private blockchain technology) to serve as a signature database to be used by other nodes in the network. From the evaluation results of the intrusion classifier, the 80:10:10 BiLSTM network performed better than GRU with a Precision of 0.99624, Recall of 0.99906, F1 Score of 0.99614, False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.00094, False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.00395 and True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.99605.

The extent to which students in the region acquire computational thinking skills remains largely unknown. To start addressing this void, this article presents findings from a cross sectional study that characterizes the computational thinking abilities of incoming students at a Chilean university with a strong emphasis on STEM disciplines. Based on more than 500 responses, this study provides evidence of significant inequalities in computational thinking across gender, type of school (private or no), and prior programming knowledge. The discussion offers insights into how these disparities relate to contextual factors of the country, such as a highly socio-economically segregated educational system, public policies focused mainly on technology access, and heavy reliance on voluntary initiatives, to develop computational thinking. The findings can enlighten upcoming research endeavors and formulate strategies to create a more equitable field for students entering STEM degrees in nations facing similar circumstances.;180-189;2;67;;"Computational thinking; Education; Programming profession; Codes; engineering education; Training; Conferences; Engineering students; gender; Latin America; Public policy; public/private schools"

As higher education institutions, we need to take responsibility for this development in every degree course we offer, and provide students with the kind of subjects and activities that best contribute to this aim. In this paper, we study the impact of following an introductory programming course on the development of the computational thinking capabilities of university students. In order to achieve this aim, a concurrent cohort observational study was carried out in which we measured both the subjective and objective computational thinking capabilities of 104 participants (50 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Psychology at the Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM), and 54 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Health Information Systems at the University of Alicante (UA)). The statistical procedures applied to test our hypotheses were a two-way mixed ANOVA, a paired-sample T-test and an independent-sample T-test. The data shows that the group at UA had an initial higher subjective perception of their computational capabilities than the group at UCAM. This perception was supported by their objective scores, which were also significantly higher. However, the subjective assessment of computational capability of the UA group diminished after exposure to the programming course, contrasting with the fact that their objective computational capabilities improved significantly. In the UCAM group, both subjective and objective capabilities remained constant over time. Based on these results, we can conclude that computational thinking capabilities are not developed naturally, but need to be trained. Providing such training to all our students, and not only to those enrolled on undergraduate degrees in engineering, is of paramount importance to allow them to face the challenges of their future professions. This paper empirically demonstrates the extent to which exposing subjects to a programming course may contribute to this aim.;72316-72325;;8;;"computational thinking; Problem-solving; Programming profession; Programming; Training; career development; Information systems; Instruments; observational study; problem-solving; Psychology; technology social factors"

Kasongo;An Advanced Intrusion Detection System for IIoT Based on GA and Tree Based Algorithms;IEEE Access;2169-3536;10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3104113;The evolution of the Internet and cloud-based technologies have empowered several organizations with the capacity to implement large-scale Internet of Things (IoT)-based ecosystems, such as Industrial IoT (IIoT). The IoT and, by virtue, the IIoT, are vulnerable to new types of threats and intrusions because of the nature of their networks. So it is crucial to develop Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that can provide the security, privacy, and integrity of IIoT networks. In this research, we propose an IDS for IIoT that was implemented using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection, and the Random Forest (RF) model was employed in the GA fitness function. The models used for the intrusion detection processes include classifiers such as the RF, Linear Regression (LR), Na•ve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Extra-Trees (ET), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The GA-RF generated 10 feature vectors for the binary classification scheme and 7 feature vectors for the multiclass classification procedure. The UNSW-NB15 is used to assess the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed approach. The experimental outcomes demonstrated that for the binary modeling process, the GA-RF achieved a test accuracy (TAC) of 87.61% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, using a feature vector that contained 16 features. These results were superior to existing IDS frameworks.;113199-113212;;9;;"machine learning; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; intrusion detection; Intrusion detection; genetic algorithm; Industrial Internet of Things; Internet of Things; Radio frequency; Random forests; Support vector machines"

We not only anchor our formalization in classical learning science frameworks but we also propose to draw on neuro-cognitive models to describe the observed behaviors of learners engaged in this activity. The chosen formalism is symbolic and is aligned on upper ontologies to ensure that the vocabulary is well specified. This allows for a better communication between the summoned research fields, namely, learning science, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling.

However, properly evaluating the effectiveness and, consequently, student progress in a course using games is still a challenge. One of the most widely implemented ways of evaluation is with an automated analysis of the code developed in the classes during the construction of digital games. Nevertheless, this topic has not yet been explored in aspects such as incremental learning, the model and teaching environment and the influences of acquiring skills and competencies of computational thinking. Motivated by this knowledge gap, this paper introduces a framework proposal to analyze the evolution of computational thinking skills in digital games classes. The framework is based on a data mining technique that aims to facilitate the discovery process of the patterns and behaviors that lead to the acquisition of computational thinking skills, by analyzing clusters with an unsupervised neural network of self-organizing maps (SOM) for this purpose. The framework is composed of a collection of processes and practices structured in data collection, data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization. A case study, using Scratch, was executed to validate this approach. The results point to the viability of the framework, highlighting the use of the visual exploratory data analysis, through the SOM maps, as an efficient tool to observe the acquisition of computational thinking skills by the student in an incremental course.;82848-82866;;7;;"education; Education; computer science education; games; Games; data mining; Data mining; Computer science; Analytical models; Conferences; data models; self-organizing feature maps; Self-organizing feature maps"

This new course was then evaluated with a survey conducted at five universities that have adopted the teaching modules for their semester-long undergraduate and graduate courses. The results show that approximately 80% of all involved students strongly agree that the hardware platform and modules significantly increased their motivation to learn. More than 70% of the students agreed that the hardware enhanced their understanding of the material The findings demonstrate that our course setup and the F1TENTH hardware effectively combine theoretical knowledge with practical application, greatly enhancing the educational outcomes and the students' computational thinking skills. Future research is needed to explore the long-term impact of hands-on learning on students' career development in intelligent autonomous systems.;4770-4783;10;10;;"computational thinking; Education; machine learning; Programming profession; Robots; robotics; Automobiles; Autonomous vehicles; control; Educational robots; Hardware; Planning; simulation; Software; Software algorithms"
