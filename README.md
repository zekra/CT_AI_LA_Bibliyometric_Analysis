Computational Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and Learning Analytics Bibliometric Dataset (2010–2025)

Version: 1.0
DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17878859
This repository contains the reproducible research materials for the study:
"Computational Thinking Research at the Intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Learning Analytics: A Multi-Database Bibliometric Mapping (2010–2025)"
The goal of this package is to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and long-term accessibility of the data processing steps, topic modeling workflow, and aggregated analytical outputs used in the published study.

Repository Contents
1. /data/ Directory
Contains non-licensed, shareable data derived from cleaned bibliographic records.
File and Description
cleaned_metadata.csv: Minimal metadata extracted from WoS/IEEE/ERIC (non-copyrighted fields only).
lda_topics.csv: Beta probabilities: term–topic weights from the LDA model.
doc_topic.csv: Gamma probabilities: document–topic distributions.
dominant_topic_by_year.csv: Annual dominant topic frequencies used in trend visualizations.
Raw bibliographic exports (WOS, IEEE, ERIC) are NOT included due to database licensing restrictions.
2. /scripts/ Directory
Contains reproducible R code used to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and LDA modeling.

Licensing
All code and aggregated data in this repository are licensed under the MIT License (see LICENSE.txt). Raw bibliographic data are NOT included and cannot be redistributed.
